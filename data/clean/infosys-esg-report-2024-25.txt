ESG Highlights Our ESG Priorities

Introduction

As the climate crisis escalates, the call for institutions to act is no longer a nudge 
it is a demand. Infosys’ journey towards sustainability began in the early 2000s. 
Over the years, our efforts have created real impact across our value chain, 
clients, and communities.

Today, there is no doubt that we are in the midst of a global phenomenon, 
moving towards an AI-first future, and the stakes have never been higher. 
For us, this isn’t just about keeping pace. It is about building AI infrastructure 
and data strategies that are fair, transparent, and deeply responsible. We are 
leveraging these capabilities not only to advance our own sustainability goals, 
but to create enterprise-scale value for our clients in ways that are future-ready 
and impact-driven.

Sustaining the momentum of carbon 
neutrality for six years, our next frontier is 
becoming climate positive in 2030, and we are 
engineering the path with precision. Backed 
by our net zero commitment, we are using 
smart systems to forecast risks, chart the way 
forward, and take decisive action. In fiscal 
2025, at the halfway mark, we share some of 
these journeys with you in this ESG report, 
proof of what is possible when purpose meets 
action, as we continue to move ahead, mining 
insights to deliver impact.

We achieved carbon 
neutrality in 2020. 
Our next frontier is 
to become climate 
positive in 2030, 
engineering the path 
with precision.

Message from the CFO

Dear stakeholder, 

We live and work in the era of Artificial Intelligence. Extreme automation, intensely data-driven decisions, personalization made possible by 
deep analytics, and intelligent systems mark our experiences at work and outside. Naturally, this also brings with it the need to consider the 
complexities of data privacy, digital equity, and the ethics of AI. The need of the hour is to harness the opportunity to progress but to do so while 
being mindful of ESG considerations. With this in mind, we have strengthened our ESG strategy to be more intentional, forward-looking, and 
purposeful. We undertook a refresh of our ESG Vision 2030 and ambitions thereof to further sharpen our focus. Our purpose – “To amplify human 
potential and create the next opportunity for people, businesses, and communities” – continues to be our guiding light. A future-ready ESG 
roadmap is the result, designed to lead responsibly in an increasingly self-running world.

Our organization's core ESG tenets were actively integrated into Infosys’ operations and decision-making processes throughout fiscal 2025. This 
has been widely recognized and applauded.

For the sixth consecutive year, we are carbon neutral across our global operations, by reducing our energy consumption, increasing our 
renewable energy sourcing, and offsetting our residual emissions through high-quality carbon credits.

We have been recognized as one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies, for the fifth year in a row, by Ethisphere.

Infosys also became the first India-headquartered Company to receive Binding Corporate Rules (BCR) approval from EU data protection 
authorities. This was a significant milestone for us, demonstrating our commitment to data privacy and compliance with EU regulations.

We have reached 13.3 million people with digital skills, including employees, clients’ workforce, students, teachers, and communities. 
175,000 patients have been onboarded to SightConnect, making eye care more accessible to all.

You will see more details as you join us in reviewing this ESG Report. As always, we invite your feedback.

ESG Highlights Our ESG Priorities

Our ESG Priorities
Every view matters
Infosys has a presence across multiple geographies, industries, services and products. The 
universe of our material matters is complex and multi-layered, one that is deeply intertwined 
with the decisions we implement and the value we seek to create through our business. Within 
the domains of E, S and G, we are constantly thinking about issues in an ever-changing and 
dynamic world and preparing for them.

In 2020, we undertook a review of the progress we made over the past decade on our 
sustainability goals and developed the lens further in a more practical and comprehensive 
manner, to broaden our ESG focus and rank our priorities in order of their importance to our 
business and our stakeholders.

Our approach
We determined our most material issues through a data-driven and consultative exercise. Material topics were 
shortlisted and prioritized based on their impact on our stakeholders and our business.

• Investor priorities through investor 

• Regulatory landscape 

surveys

• Global indices reporting and 

assessment frameworks, thought 
papers1, and partnerships with 
global organization2

• Peer benchmarking in the IT industry

• Media and public opinion, using AI 

tools for insights

 in jurisdictions 
relevant for Infosys

• Broader stakeholder 

consultations

• Specific ESG impact 

areas in geographical 
 and service line 
contexts in relation to 
mega trends

• Benchmarking 
 against best 
practices 
among peers 
in IT and other 
industries

• Belief audits with the Management to 

 understand priorities

• Employee engagement surveys, focus

ESG Vision 2030 Refresh

Being the mid-point in our journey to realize our 
ESG Vision 2030, 2025 was a good time to reflect 
on our progress while reviewing our material 
topics for their continued relevance to growing 
stakeholder expectations. This detailed exercise 
resulted in crafting our roadmap towards a climate 
positive future where we envisage being net zero 
in 2030 while staying true to our commitment to 
be carbon neutral every year. Our digital skilling 
efforts are now focused on enabling skilling for 

jobs while we amplify communities through Tech 
for Good initiatives, job creation, and CSR efforts 
including employee volunteering, healthcare 
interventions, and women’s empowerment. We will 
nurture workplace inclusivity while aiming to be the 
employer of choice in the regions we operate. Our 
commitment to responsible governance remains 
steadfast as we shape thinking in data privacy and 
information management and lead best practice. 

Our refreshed ESG Vision 2030 ambitions came into 
effect starting April 1, 2025.

Double Materiality Assessment
This year, we undertook a double materiality assessment in advance of our reporting commitment to the 
Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). We leveraged our Global Reporting Initiatives (GRI)-based 
material topics to identify material sustainability-related matters using the double materiality framework guided 
by recommendations of the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG), marking a key milestone 
in the advancement of our readiness towards compliance with EU CSRD. The double materialty assessment 
identified ESG matters that are material to Infosys based on potential and actual Impacts, Risks, and Opportunities 
(IROs). We will continue to monitor the directive and revisit our double materiality assessment to ensure it reflects 
evolving regulatory requirements as well as changes to our business. This exercise has been reviewed and 
approved by the Board.

Our approach
We adopted a research-backed consultative approach grounded in analytics. Material ESG matters were seeded 
and ranked based on criteria defined for impact materiality – the positive and negative ESG-related impacts 
connected to the business – and financial materiality – the ESG-related financial risks and opportunities.

1. Value chain identification 

Our value chain encompasses the activities, 
resources and relationships used and relied on 
to deliver our services. Identifying and mapping 
Infosys’ value chain was the foundation in the 
double materiality assessment process. This 
helped us identify where the most significant 
ESG IROs occur in our operations, and across 
our upstream and downstream value chain. Our 
key upstream partners include IT & services and 
manpower suppliers, while our customers are the 
key downstream partners. 

2. Determine ESG matters 

We considered all ESRS-relevant sustainability 
topics, sub-topics, and sub-sub-topics. Further, 
we identified relevant ESG matters across our 
value chain through a comprehensive review of 
our existing ESG priorities, our Enterprise Risk 
Management (ERM) system, key priorities for 
stakeholders, and other evolving priorities in 
the sector. 

3. Identify impacts, risks and opportunities 
Built on the list of previously identified ESG 
matters material to Infosys, we developed a list 
of IROs, to be further used as the base for the 
double materiality assessment. To ensure we 
fully integrated the financial and risk perspective, 
we considered the enterprise-wide risk register 
results as part of the process. Further, we 
reviewed several industry reports as well as 
academic research papers. 

4. Stakeholder engagement 

In carrying out the double materiality 
assessment, engagement with stakeholders 
both internal as well as external has helped 
us prioritize the IROs. We have identified and 

prioritized our stakeholders based on those 
who might be impacted by our activities and 
those who could influence our functioning. 
As part of the materiality assessment, we have 
identified six key stakeholders: employees and 
sub-contractors, clients, investor/shareholders, 
suppliers/partners, government/regulators, 
and communities. Due to the diverse nature 
of the stakeholder groups, we use different 
channels of consultation and engagement 
regarding a range of topics, including ESG. For 
the double materiality assessment, we refined 
our list of identified IROs through consultations 
with internal stakeholders, including the ESG 
Ambition owners and the ESG Council. 

5. Determine impact and financial 

materiality 
We used an average scoring approach, and 
the impacts were assessed based on their 
scale, scope, irremediability (in the case of 
negative impacts) and likelihood; and risks 
and opportunities on their magnitude and 
likelihood. The likelihood was calculated only 
for material IROs. 

Impact materiality score: The procedure to 
establish impact materiality was principally aligned 
with the European Financial Reporting Advisory 
Group’s (EFRAG) implementation guideline, 
assessing scale, scope and irremediability. For 
scale, we assessed the size of the impact on the 
environment and people; for scope, its reach 
or geographical span, and, where applicable, 
irremediability scores considered efforts that might 
be needed to remediate our negative impacts. 

Financial materiality score: The risks and 
opportunities were assessed based on their 

Infosys | ESG REPORT 2024-25

 
 
INSIGHT TO IMPACT

ENVIRONMENT

SOCIAL

GOVERNANCE

Introduction

Message from the CFO Corporate Overview Approach to Reporting

ESG Highlights Our ESG Priorities

likelihood of occurrence and the potential 
magnitude of their financial effects in the 
short-,mediumand long-term. The likelihood 
was assessed on the probability of the risk or 
opportunity materializing (e.g., almost certain, 
likely, possible, unlikely), while magnitude was 
based on the significance of the financial effect 
if this risk or opportunity were to materialize 
(e.g., above or below the threshold). The 
procedure to determine financial materiality was 
fundamentally aligned with Infosys’ enterprise 
risk management framework. 

Threshold was selected using a qualitative and 
quantitative method, based on the topic’s alignment 
with Infosys’ strategy and risk approach, continuity 
with previous materiality assessments, and relevance 
of the information to the value chain partners.

6. Finalize material matters and reporting 

Materiality matrix based on DMA

obligations 
The preliminary results of IRO scores were 
aggregated, deliberated, and validated at 
workshops with ESG Ambition leaders at Infosys 
and by the ESG Council. The workshops were 
conducted to include a top-down perspective 
and prevent subjective bias. We analyzed all the 
impacts and financial results to build a prioritized 
list of material matters. We defined the threshold 
for prioritization to highlight ESG matters that 
came extremely high on either an impact or 
financial perspective or both. We mapped the 
material IROs to the existing GRI disclosures and 
applicable ESRS data points.

Outcomes
The double materiality assessment principally endorsed our previously identified ESG priorities.

With the increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across the value chain and emerging 
AI regulations, we incorporated impacts, risks and opportunities arising due to AI as part of the 
assessment. For e.g., evolving frameworks and regulations for AI leading to compliance challenges, 
and leveraging generative AI advancements in climate solutions, etc.

During this assessment, we recognized a substantial overlap between two previously distinct priority 
topics – Tech for Good and Energizing Local Communities. Since both are interlinked in terms of 
underlying drivers and relevance to Infosys, we made the strategic decision to merge these into a 
single theme – Amplifying Communities.

Infosys’ pledge: Climate Positive in 2030

Infosys recognizes that climate change is more than an environmental challenge—it is a fundamental issue that affects economies, communities, and 
the way we live and work. As our business expands across regions, we are aware that growth goes hand in hand with responsibility. Expansion brings 
with it increased carbon emissions, resource consumption, and environmental pressure. That is why, we have embedded sustainability into the core 
of our operations through smarter design, adoption of clean energy, carbon offset initiatives, and biodiversity enhancement programs. Our ambition 
doesn’t stop at mitigation. We are working towards climate positivity, aiming to restore more than we consume, and contribute actively to the health 
of our ecosystems and communities. We are implementing large-scale agroforestry projects across several states in India. This shift towards climate 
positivity reflects our belief that the true measure of success lies not only in growth, but also in how much we give back. By aligning our business 
strategy with climate resilience and long-term environmental stewardship, we are building value—for our stakeholders, society, and future generations.

Infosys’ climate positive strategy builds on the Company’s achievements over the last two decades

Greener by design: Reimagining 
infrastructure and buildings
Globally, buildings contribute nearly 40% of GHG 
emissions. For Infosys, they represent the most 
energy-intensive asset class, and therefore, the 
most powerful lever for emissions reduction. All 
new developments are designed to achieve the 
highest level of LEED certifications, with over 29.7 
million sq. ft. of green-certified buildings already 
operational. From design to operation, we adopt 
a lifecycle approach to emissions, maximizing 
efficiency at every stage. By integrating low-carbon 
strategies into design, material selection, and 
construction practices, we create buildings that are 
resource-efficient. 

Greener cooling 
Solidifying its ongoing commitment to sustainability 
and innovation, Infosys continues to adopt advanced 
technologies that reduce environmental impact 
and optimize operational efficiency. Our Indore 
campus is now home to Hydrofluoroolefin (HFO)

magnetic chillers, marking a significant step in 
climate-conscious cooling. HFOs offer a responsible 
alternative to traditional refrigerants, while magnetic 
chiller technology boosts energy efficiency and 
reduces operating costs. Building on this success, 
Infosys plans to expand the use of HFO chillers to 
its Noida and Hyderabad campuses. In parallel, 
all critical air-conditioning units at the Bengaluru 
campus have been upgraded to R-22-free systems.

Water-efficient construction
We also emphasize resource conservation during 
construction, by using water-efficient curing 
compounds that reduce consumption and 
environmental load.

Post-tensioned (PT) slabs decrease concrete and 
steel use, cutting embodied carbon and enhancing 

Other green initiatives

Low-carbon concrete mixes: 
By replacing up to 50% of Portland 
cement with Ground Granulated Blast 
Furnace Slag (GGBFS) and fly ash, we 
have reduced over 7,990 tonnes of CO₂e 
in a single project.

Sustainable materials: Manufactured 
sand and recycled steel reduce reliance 
on virgin resources while maintaining 
structural integrity.

Eco-friendly façades: 
We use ORAE Glass (70% recycled 
content) and Hydro CIRCAL 75R 
aluminum, which has 54% lower carbon 
emissions than conventional glass.

Reducing embodied carbon
Infosys continues to embed lifecycle 
thinking into the design and construction 
of its campuses, ensuring that our built 
infrastructure aligns with our climate 
goals. In FY 2023-24, we undertook cradleto-grave Life Cycle Assessments (LCA, A1–
C4 stages) for new buildings in our Pune, 
Hyderabad, and Bengaluru campuses to 
measure embodied carbon and identify 
optimization opportunities across the 
building lifecycle.

The assessments revealed that the highest 
environmental impact occurred during 
the product stage (A1–A3)—driven 
primarily by emissions from concrete 
and reinforced steel used in horizontal 
structures such as beams and slabs. For 
instance, embodied carbon intensity 
ranged from 616 to 651 kg CO₂e/m², with 
concrete and steel accounting for up to 
80% of material-related emissions in some 
sites. To mitigate this, we piloted multiple 
material optimization strategies. In 
Hyderabad, replacing 50% of cement with 
GGBFS reduced embodied carbon intensity 
by 15.8%. In Pune, using 30% recycled 
content in concrete and 15% in steel 
reinforcements achieved a total reduction 
of 11.2%.

Looking ahead, we are exploring further 
interventions such as high-recycledcontent aluminum façades, low-carbon 
glass, increased fly ash in AAC blocks, and 
emerging low-impact alternatives like 
agrocrete and green steel.

ISO 50001:2018 certification
As a demonstration of our commitment towards environmental stewardship and driving positive 
outcomes, we implemented an Energy Management System and achieved ISO 50001:2018 
certification for our Bengaluru and Mysuru campuses during the year. We plan to continue improving 
our sustainability initiatives by including other locations in the certification process in a phased 
manner. This has enabled us to focus our efforts on improving energy efficiency, energy performance, 
and energy consumption.

structural efficiency. Ready-mix or gypsum 
plasters ensure quality, reduce waste, and lower 
emissions through controlled application. Through 
these integrated efforts, we are not just building 
sustainably—we are redefining what responsible 
construction looks like in a net zero future.

Renewable energy 
Infosys was the first Indian Company to pledge 
commitment to RE100 in 2015. Over the years, we 
have ramped up our efforts towards our renewable 
energy goals. We source renewable energy 
through a diversified mix of captive solar plants, 
onsite installations, and strategic green energy 
procurement mechanisms. 

• Infosys operates captive renewable energy plants 
with a combined capacity of 60 megawatts (MW), 
which form a significant component of our clean 
energy mix. These plants play a pivotal role in 
reducing our dependence on grid electricity and 
ensuring a steady, self-sustained supply of green 
power across key campuses.

• To further scale our renewable energy portfolio, 

we are actively leveraging Power Purchase 
Agreements (PPAs) and procuring green power 
through government-supported green tariff 
mechanisms offered by Distribution Companies 
(DISCOMs). These arrangements are instrumental 
in expanding our access to clean energy beyond 
our own generation capacity. 

• In addition, we have made extensive investments 

in rooftop and ground-mounted solar photovoltaic 
(PV) systems across our infrastructure. These 
installations are now present in 100% of our 
owned campuses. This wide deployment of onsite

solar assets not only contributes to meeting 
our operational energy needs sustainably but 
also reinforces our long-term commitment to 
decentralized, low-carbon energy generation.

Advancing energy 
performance
Integrating sustainability in every aspect 
of our building portfolio is helping create 
workplaces where employees can work, 
collaborate and innovate in the most energyefficient environments possible. While our 
buildings over the years have demonstrated 
an Energy Performance Index (EPI) of 75 
kWh/m2/year, our greenfield projects across 
India are now being designed for an EPI of 
60 kWh/m2/year, one of the lowest in the IT 
services sector, pushing the boundaries of 
energy efficiency further. This performance 
is made possible through passive design 
strategies such as orientation, solar shading 
and insulation, innovative radiant cooling, 
efficient equipment and automation.

Approach to tackle Scope 3
Tackling Scope 3 emissions is critical to Infosys’ 
journey towards becoming climate positive. Our 
strategy goes beyond measurement by focusing on 
supplier collaboration, low-carbon procurement, 
sustainable employee mobility, and circularity in 
operations. From business travel to capital goods 
and work-from-home emissions, we are embedding 
climate action across our extended ecosystem with 
a focus on emissions in the following categories:
• Sustainable mobility
• Business travel
• Waste
• Work from home
• Upstream leased assets
• Transmission and distribution loss
• Capital goods

Sustainable mobility
Employee transportation accounts for a significant 
portion of our indirect emissions. At our Bengaluru 
headquarters, we are collaborating with local 
authorities to extend metro connectivity to 
our campus while promoting public transport 
alternatives. Our comprehensive commute survey 
provided valuable data on travel patterns, enabling 
targeted emission reduction strategies. We have 
introduced EV buses for employee commute and 
installed 1,325 EV charging points across campuses, 
powered by renewable energy.

Value chain decarbonization: 
A collaborative climate strategy
With nearly 30% of our emissions linked to capital 
goods, decarbonizing our supply chain is a key 
priority. Infosys engages a wide range of partners, 
including OEMs, aggregators, contractors, and 
consultants, to tackle Scope 3 emissions through 
measurement, and more so, by driving behavior 
change, building capacity, and raising climate 
ambition. Through strategic collaborations, we are 
advancing low-carbon, sustainable practices across 
our value chain.

Engaging suppliers 
As climate-related performance becomes a 
competitive differentiator, clients increasingly 
include Infosys’ climate credentials in Requests 
For Proposals (RFPs) and procurement decisions, 
reflecting the market-wide pivot towards 
sustainable partnerships. Infosys is committed 
to raising this bar within its own supply chain, 
ensuring that suppliers not only meet compliance 
requirements but actively contribute to emissions 
reduction. Our approach is guided by an integrated 
climate governance framework. Together, these 
measures are creating a supplier ecosystem 
that is climate-resilient, regulation-ready, and 
future-facing, reflecting Infosys’ vision of shared 
sustainability leadership.

In FY 2024, Infosys launched a strategic initiative 
to accelerate decarbonization in its supply chain, 
focusing on key IT hardware manufacturing 
suppliers, prioritized by spend. This initiative 
focused on securing detailed, forward-looking 
decarbonization roadmaps from these partners.

Carbon offsets and clean energy access 
Since 2016, Infosys has actively pursued impactful 
carbon reduction projects across India, focusing 
on energy access for rural communities. Through 
10 ongoing initiatives, including improved 
cookstoves and household biogas systems, we are 
delivering cleaner, more efficient energy to over 
2,72,000 families, transforming lives and reducing 
emissions. We observed our biogas projects 
empower women in rural India, who utilize 
biogas slurry to cultivate thriving kitchen gardens 
and vegetable farms, enhancing food security 
and generating income. Such successes across 
numerous villages underscore the multifaceted 

positive impact of our energy projects on farming 
communities.

Moving towards greater environmental 
impacts
To further our positive impact on the environment 
through our projects, we recognize that a 
comprehensive climate strategy necessitates 
removing existing carbon dioxide from the 
atmosphere. This understanding has led us to 
strategically integrate agroforestry projects into 
our climate action portfolio. Recognizing the 
challenges posed by traditional farming practices 
and climate change—including soil degradation, 

reduced productivity, and economic instability for 
small and marginal farmers—we are committed 
to fostering sustainable agricultural practices that 
directly remove CO2 from the atmosphere through 
carbon sequestration.

Agroforestry, by integrating trees, shrubs, and 
crops, offers a transformative approach to 
enhance ecosystem services, diversify income 
streams, and climate-proof farm livelihoods. These 
projects will directly contribute to the removal of 
atmospheric CO2.

Our proposed multilayer agroforestry initiatives 

aim to restore degraded lands and uplift rural 
communities through sustainable agricultural 
practices. We commenced the agroforestry 
projects in FY2025 and planted about 4,07,000 
saplings. By embracing agroforestry projects, 
Infosys is reinforcing its commitment to long-term 
sustainability, creating resilient communities, 
and directly contributing to the removal of 
atmospheric CO2, complementing our ongoing 
efforts to reduce our operational footprint. This 
strategic evolution from emissions reduction 
to CO2 removal underscores our dedication to 
comprehensive climate action.

ASSURE Decarbonizing the building sector in India

Infosys has long been a global leader in designing and operating sustainable, high-performance buildings, setting industry benchmarks. To scale 
this impact, Infosys launched ASSURE (Accelerating Sustainable Super-Efficient Real Estate), a multi-stakeholder platform in partnership with 
the Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS). ASSURE showcases Infosys’ campuses as living case studies, enabling the replication of proven 
strategies for energy-efficient, climate-resilient infrastructure. Launched on May 09, 2024, the forum convened experts, policymakers, and industry 
leaders, including Peter Rumsey (Co-founder and CEO of Point Energy Innovations and visiting faculty at Stanford University, and a global authority 
on building decarbonization), to drive systemic change and ensure that India’s future buildings are not only smarter but radically more sustainable.

ASSURE, anchored by IIHS in a knowledge 
partnership with Infosys, is envisioned as the world’s 
largest organized initiative for realizing highperformance buildings (HPBs). It builds on over a 
decade of domestic expertise, including Infosys’ 
own success in saving over US$250 million through 
HPB implementation. Running from 2024 to 2030, 
ASSURE prioritizes HPBs in the light of: 
• The large, energyand emission-intensive growth in 

India’s real estate sector. 

• The risk of long-term energy lock-ins, poor living / 

working conditions, and circular economy setbacks 
under business-as-usual scenarios.

• The transformative potential of HPBs to meet 

goals in climate action, innovation, job creation, 
and sustainable growth.

With a focus on commercial buildings, due to their 
higher energy and emission intensity per unit 
area, ASSURE will provide technical assistance to 
India’s largest developers for lighthouse projects 
totaling 100 million sq. ft., skill and upskill 12,000 
individuals, support 30 curated innovators, launch 
a performance measurement and verification 
platform to incentivize HPB adoption and financing, 
and engage policymakers and financial stakeholders 
to promote enabling policies and financing 
frameworks for HPBs.

ASSURE aims to demonstrate 
100 million sq. ft. of highperformance commercial 
buildings in India by 2030

Policy Advocacy 
Climate Lobbying Infosys has a structured approach to ESG focused public policy activities and trade association memberships, ensuring 
transparency and alignment with its sustainability goals(refer to BRSR for more details). We actively collaborate with key industry bodies and global 
organizations to support policy development that benefits society and the environment. One of such examples is ASSURE (Accelerating Sustainable 
and Super-Efficient Real Estate), a multi-stakeholder platform in partnership with the Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS) with a vision to 
accelerate decarbonization of the Indian building sector through dialogue, data, skilling and policy reforms. 

Public policy engagement and governance is led by the company's leadership. The company’s stance on climate-related policies such as Paris

Water

Water is fast becoming one of the most critical sustainability challenges, shaping global conversations around climate resilience, biodiversity 
preservation, and human well-being. Many of our campuses are located in regions already facing significant water stress. Recognizing this early, 
Infosys understood that its responsibility must extend beyond operational efficiency. Aligned with our climate-positive goals, we continue to be 
committed to reducing our water footprint and enhancing water availability in the communities where we operate. The growing global water 
crisis, coupled with the critical role of water in sustaining our operations, workforce, and surrounding communities, made water stewardship a clear 
and pressing area of focus.

100% wastewater recycled

By 2030, 50% of the global population is projected to face water scarcity, and we have been acting on this for more than two decades. Infosys endorsed the UN Global Compact's CEO Water Mandate in 
2014, ratifying its commitment to "zero wastewater discharge", and we have maintained zero wastewater discharge across our campuses. This has since evolved into a pioneering water stewardship 
model. Over the last decade, Infosys has moved from water-efficient campus design to institutionalizing a model of water stewardship—one that regenerates ecosystems, safeguards community water 
security, and sets benchmarks for the IT sector. 

As part of the climate-positive initiatives, Infosys plans to recharge more than its consumption (fresh water and treated water) and unit intensity across its operations.

Our approach
Reducing our water footprint 
We continue to work towards reducing our water 
consumption through demand reduction measures. 
These include low-flow fixtures, sensor-based 
taps, pressure compensating valves and aerators, 
and smart water metering. Our new buildings are 
designed for less than 24 liters/day per person total 
water consumption, which comprises 15 liters/
day fresh water. 100% of the wastewater within 
our campuses is treated and reused for flushing, 
gardening and cooling tower makeup purposes.

Rainwater harvesting continues to be a focus area. 
40 lakes across our campuses have a capacity 
to store over 430 million liters of rainwater. 409 
injection wells help in recharging over 20 million 
liters of rainwater per day, thereby improving the 
water table and enhancing water availability in the 
communities surrounding us.

We address water positivity through a threepronged strategy that drives both internal 
excellence and external impact:

Efficiency
Designing for a 
low-water future. 
Minimizing 
consumption

Lake rejuvenation projects
Our commitment to water stewardship extends 
beyond operational efficiency to creating 
meaningful impact in the communities we operate. 
By collaborating with local stakeholders, we help 
restore water bodies and raise awareness about 
responsible water use. These efforts strengthen 
community resilience and foster a shared sense of 
responsibility for natural resources, ensuring that the 
benefits of water stewardship reach far beyond our 

organizational boundaries. Our campuses are living 
laboratories for water stewardship.

Rejuvenation of lakes is vital for India’s sustainable 
development. As water scarcity and urban pollution 
grow, restoring lakes ensures water security, recharges 
groundwater, and supports biodiversity. These 
ecosystems play a key role in climate resilience and 
provide livelihoods to local communities. Leadership 
at all levels, government, industry, and civil society, 

must collaborate to protect these natural assets. 
Reviving lakes is an environmental imperative and 
a socio-economic necessity. It reflects responsible 
governance and long-term vision. 

Infosys has taken up lake rejuvenation projects across 
multiple cities in India through local stakeholders and 
NGOs. The 11 lake rejuvenation projects currently 
taken up by Infosys is expected to create an additional 
capacity of 4.3 billion liters thereby enhancing the 

water table, increasing water access, and improving 
health and wellness in the communities.

Water Waste

Waste

Waste management is a complex global challenge, with practices and effectiveness varying 
widely across regions. Rising populations and shifting consumption habits are driving a surge 
in waste generation, while poor waste management continues to pollute land, water, and air, 
raising alarm over environmental degradation. Developing countries face particular hurdles, 
including limited resources, rapid urbanization, and inadequate infrastructure to manage waste. 
The World Bank estimates global per capita waste generation at 0.74 kg per day, with projections 
indicating a rise to 3.4 billion tonnes annually by 2050, more than twice the growth rate of the 
global population. While traditional waste systems can manage annual costs, transitioning to a 
circular economy, through prevention, sustainable design, and full lifecycle management— offers 
greater long-term benefits. For Infosys, waste is a priority material topic with clear relevance 
to our stakeholders. Our strategy is framed around circularity. Using a data-driven approach, 
we aim to continuously improve our waste strategy and enhance alignment with our broader 
environmental, social, and governance commitments.

Our approach
Our waste management strategy is firmly 
rooted in the principles of circularity, aiming 
not only to minimize environmental impact 
but also to reimagine waste as a valuable 
resource. This vision is supported by a robust 
combination of technology, behavioral change, 
and strong governance, with the ultimate 
goal of achieving zero waste to landfill while 
advancing global sustainability objectives. Our 

waste-related disclosures are aligned with globally 
recognized frameworks to ensure transparency 
and accountability. Our reporting is guided by the 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 306: Waste 2020 
standard, as well as India’s Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report (BRSR) requirements. 
We tackle the waste challenge through a clear, 
structured strategy that spans the entire lifecycle of 
our operations. Our 5R hierarchy—Refuse, Reduce, 
Reuse, Refurbish/Repurpose, and Recycle.

Towards zero waste to landfill
Through targeted recycling, reuse, and co-processing 
initiatives, we continue to reduce the amount of 
waste sent to landfills. Our waste diversion strategies 
not only help us achieve environmental goals but 
also contribute to resource conservation.

Treatment
We have created capacity to treat 100% of the 
organic waste within our campuses (food waste and 
garden waste), through biogas plants and organic 
waste converters. The resulting biogas is used in 
food court kitchens and the compost is used in the 
landscaping. Sewage sludge generated from the 
sewage treatment plants is treated in solar drying 
greenhouses, and the resulting dry sludge is mixed 
with compost and used in landscaping.

Segregation
Effective segregation of waste is achieved using wet 
and dry bins, and further segregation into different 
waste streams such as paper, plastic, metal, wood, 
etc. Storage of waste in scientifically designed 
scrap yards with segregated waste stream enables 
effective disposal through authorized recyclers for 
each stream of waste.

TRUE zero certification
We have achieved TRUE zero certification for waste 
from Green Business Certification Institute (GBCI) 
for 3 of our campuses. More campuses are in the 
process of getting TRUE zero certification.

Waste is an important dimension of the HSEMS 
policy, aligned with ISO 14001:2015 standards across 
all India locations in line with our HSE Strategy.

Governance framework 
Our governance framework includes:

Policy & Protocols 
Standard operating procedures for each waste 
category, updated annually or as necessary, to 
reflect changes in laws and best practices. 

Audits & Legal Review 
Regular internal and third-party audits verify 
compliance; any non-conformances trigger 
corrective action plans. 

Vendor Evaluation Framework 
We assess and approve waste-management vendors 
based on regulatory adherence, capacity for resource 

E-waste management
As a technology-driven organization, the generation 
of e-waste is an inherent aspect of our operations. 
Our e-waste stream comprises a wide range of items, 
including IT hardware, mobile devices, printers, 
cartridges, electrical appliances such as refrigerators, 
microwaves, air conditioners, lithium-ion batteries, 
and various electronic accessories.

We have adopted a forward-looking e-waste 
management strategy that prioritizes 
refurbishment over disposal wherever possible. 
This refurbishment-first model not only extends the 
lifestyle of electronic assets but also aligns closely 
with circular economy objectives. For equipment 
that cannot be refurbished, we work exclusively 
with authorized recyclers who are rigorously 
assessed for compliance with legal standards 
and the degree of circularity embedded in their 
recycling processes.

Employee and community engagement 
We actively engage our employees and the 
surrounding communities to reinforce and extend 
our zero-waste goals. Building upon our strong 
stakeholder collaborations, we aim to create a 
culture of waste-consciousness both within and 
beyond the organization. Our approach combines 
education, hands-on activities, and community 
engagement programs to drive behavioral change 
and deepen understanding of waste circularity.

We run regular awareness campaigns—including 
mailers, workshops, and digital challenges—
designed to inform employees about best 
practices in waste segregation and reduction. 
These campaigns have featured initiatives like 
“Beat Plastic Pollution”, where teams compete to 
minimize single-use plastics, and internal “waste 
plogging” events combining litter collection with 
jogging. Such activities not only reduce waste 
on campus but also inspire participants to adopt 
sustainable habits beyond the workplace. 

of organic-waste recovery. Sustainable-product 
giveaways—such as reusable bags and bottles—
reinforce the message of waste prevention, while 
community clean-up drives help improve the 
areas surrounding our campuses. By empowering 
employees as ambassadors and collaborating with 
community stakeholders, we create a virtuous 
cycle of awareness and action. This peoplecentric engagement complements our technical 
and operational initiatives, ensuring that waste 
management becomes everyone’s responsibility 
and drives us closer to our zero-waste ambition.

Team members from our Mysuru campus 
landscaping unit participated in a plastic waste 
collection drive organized by the Karnataka State 
Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) at Chamundi Hills. 
The effort covered the temple surroundings and 
the entire 1,000-step path leading to the foothills, 
demonstrating our deep-rooted commitment to 
environmental stewardship both on and 
off campus.

To extend our impact into the community, we 
partner with local schools and NGOs for student 
outreach programs. Volunteers distribute compost 
and biogas slurry generated onsite to home 
gardeners, demonstrating the practical benefits 

Innovations in waste management 
Our focused efforts on reducing diversion from 
landfills resulted in piloting conversion of garden 
waste into biomass briquettes in our Hyderabad 
location. 

This project resulted in manufacturing biomass 
briquettes by the service provider which is then 
utilized as alternative fuel in boilers, in cement industry 
etc. We also piloted an initiative where organic 
waste is transformed to compost with an innovative 
methodology using Black Soldier Flies at our Mangalore 
campus. This resulted in fast decomposition and more 
nutrient rich compost compared to vermicompost 
which is used as manure in our campus landscape. 

We also carried out creative sustainability initiatives 
by repurposing materials such as unused cable drums, 
tyres, wood logs, plastic cans and bottles into aesthetic 
items like chairs, pots, and decorative pieces which are 
displayed on our campuses.

Training & Awareness 
We have a dedicated ESG learning portal on LEX our 
learning platform for all our employees worldwide. The 
portal boasts over 100 courses, assessments, leader talks, 
articles and publications on ESG topics. Fortnightly 
publications on ESG through the ESG learning series 
ensures employee learning and continuous engagement 
on a variety of topics. In FY 2025, we had 20+ 
publications, spanning introduction to sustainability, 
water management best practices, circular economy, 
effective waste management practices, anti-corruption 
and anti-bribery and more. Beyond training, employees 
are also encouraged to be part of initiatives to build 
‘responsible citizenship’ through vibrant Development 
Center CSR and Eco volunteer groups in order to 
strengthen learning, awareness and practices in 
environmental topics in the larger community.

Fostering inclusive growth

Infosys' initiative to enable digital talent at scale is 
a material issue for its stakeholders, as it directly 
supports inclusive growth, talent readiness, and 
equitable access to opportunities—priorities 
identified through our engagement with various 
groups. Advancements in technologies such as 
AI and smart automation can be leveraged to 
boost productivity and address broader societal

other stakeholders are increasingly focused on how 
companies are bridging the digital divide, especially 
as demand for digital talent surges globally. This 
aligns with Principle 8 of the BRSR which emphasizes 
inclusive growth and equitable development.
Expanding digital skilling efforts is not only a matter 
of good governance but also critical to Infosys’ social 
license to operate and long-term value creation. 

Approach

Leveraging our robust digital platform 
infrastructure, Infosys plans to scale through 
a multi-pronged approach: 
• Enhancing programs focused on women 

and girls.

• Expanding internships, and integrating AIpowered platforms with job marketplace 
features. 

Going forward, we plan to expand the strategy to 
deeper collaboration with national digital skilling 
initiatives and universities, embedding integrated 
curriculums to build industry-ready talent. A diverse 
distribution across geographies, partnerships 
with clients, governments, academic bodies, and 
direct-to-learner engagement further underscore 
our commitment to democratizing digital skills and 
enabling opportunities for everyone.

Skilling the Infosys workforce

Staying relevant has never been more critical, 
as the demand for new skills is outpacing the 
rate at which they can be acquired. To keep up, 
skilling programs must be built around continuous 
learning—with a strong focus on employee 
growth and adaptability. Our AI-powered learning

Skilling the community

Infosys is committed to democratizing digital education through its Springboard initiative, 
which offers free access to quality online learning for students, educators, and underserved 
communities across India. With features like Lab on Wheels and the Springboard Makers Lab, 
Infosys brings hands-on learning experiences to remote areas, breaking barriers of geography and 
connectivity. These community-focused programs are not only promoting digital inclusion but are 
also nurturing a broader, future-ready talent pool for the digital economy..

Infosys Springboard
In keeping with Vision 2030, we believe that 
access to digital education should be a right, not a 
privilege. That belief led to the creation of Infosys 
Springboard under our Tech for Good charter, a 
platform dedicated to bridging the digital divide 
and ensuring that no one is left behind in an 
increasingly connected world. Today, Springboard 
has grown into a catalyst for digital inclusion and 
sustainable development. Millions of learners across 
India, whether in bustling cities or remote villages, 
are accessing free, self-paced online courses that 
cover emerging technologies and essential soft 

skills. In partnership with many universities, and 
reaching more than 9 million registered users, 
Springboard is reshaping the way education is 
delivered, making it accessible, inclusive, and 
future-ready.

Springboard is more than a learning platform. It is 
a launchpad. Through career guidance, internships, 
and initiatives like "Her Journey to Success," we 
are preparing learners not just for jobs, but for 
meaningful careers, particularly empowering 
women and girls to shape their futures with 
confidence. Innovation drives everything we do.

Samskruti College students get hands-on experience in robotics with the SpringBoard Maker Lab on wheels.

By integrating AI, VR, and AR technologies, 
Springboard delivers an engaging, personalized 
learning experience. Our collaborations with 
government agencies, universities, NGOs, and 
industry leaders amplify our reach, while our 
commitment to underserved and differently-abled 
communities ensures that no one is left behind.

We also know that barriers to education aren't only 
digital—they are physical. That’s why we created the 
Springboard Lab on Wheels—a mobile classroom 
bringing world-class education to the remotest 
corners of India. Launched in Karnataka and piloted in 
Pune in February 2024, the Lab reaches learners who 

might otherwise be disconnected from opportunity. 

For areas with limited connectivity, our Springboard 
Raspberry Pi solution allows students to access 
content offline, uploading their progress once they 
reconnect. And at the Springboard Makers Lab in 
Pune’s Symbiosis Lavale Campus, students now 
have access to hands-on, experiential learning that 
turns theory into practice. At Infosys, we are not 
just preparing individuals for a digital future, we 
are helping build a more equitable, empowered 
world. Through Springboard, we are proving that 
when technology meets purpose, the possibilities 
are limitless.

lives by 2025 across education, healthcare, and e-governance. This extraordinary reach reflects not just scale, but sustained intent to democratize 
opportunity through responsible digital enablement.

Meaningful impact through technology
Tech for Good is a vital priority for Infosys 
stakeholders, reflecting our commitment to 
driving meaningful and inclusive impact through 
technology. We engage communities, an essential 

stakeholder group, through local interactions, 
partnerships with NGOs, and digital channels. Our 
initiatives are designed to address structural gaps 
like digital literacy, preventive healthcare, and 
inclusive education, to empower individuals from 

marginalized groups to participate in the digital 
economy. In doing so, Infosys reinforces its social 
license to operate, expand trust capital, and align 
with the long-term interests of stakeholders. This 
dual lens, impact and insight, defines how we lead 
in the era of sustainable technology.

to vital services like healthcare, education, and 
banking, especially in lowand middle-income

Pioneering impact platforms: Healthcare, identity & education
Spotlight on SightConnect
Launched in 2024, SightConnect continues to 
make eye care more accessible to all. It is a mobile 
app created through the Tech for Good program 
in collaboration with Infosys Foundation and the 

LV Prasad Eye Institute (LVPEI). It is designed to be 
simple, free, and available anytime, anywhere. It is 
an easy-to-use eye care tool, allowing individuals 
and community health workers to conduct basic 
eye tests, help diagnose eye conditions early, 

and allow smooth referrals to specialists. These 
simple, but crucial functions are helping prevent 
avoidable vision loss in communities where 
access to healthcare initiatives is either lacking 
or unaffordable. 

Total patients onboarded: 
1,75,000
Referred to doctors: 35%

Multi-lingual capability
The app supports multi-lingual eye 
test questionnaires. Automated 
translations for both the app text and 
the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) 
system, powered by the Ai4bharat 
IndicTrans2 – Bhashini model ensures 
that language isn’t a barrier to reach 
accessible care to India’s diverse 
communities.

Smart, AI-powered features
With features like AI-based triage, facial recognition, 
and adaptive brightness, SightConnect is proving 
to be a practical, reliable solution for low-resource 
settings—taking quality eye care one step closer to 
everyone. Advanced facial contour recognition and 
adaptive screen brightness ensure reliable results even 
in challenging environments. Through visual acuity 
testing and a questionnaire, SightConnect generates a 
preliminary assessment of eye health, indicating whether 
an urgent or routine consultation is recommended. It 
has been tested successfully in clinical trials at LVPEI. 
SightConnect’s AI model that screens for early signs of 
cataracts and red eye is undergoing development.

Communication
Even with access to technology, patients may 
struggle to connect with health workers or 
may do so without the necessary information. 
Similarly, healthcare workers often face 
challenges in relaying accurate diagnoses to 
physicians. Bridging these gaps—by effectively 
connecting patients, healthcare workers, and 
doctors—can mean the difference between 
limited access to care and truly benefiting from 
it. Strengthening communication across this 
chain has reinforced the eye care ecosystem 
and extended essential services to individuals 
who often go without.

Testimonials 
The app has already made a difference, real-life 
stories show how early intervention through 
SightConnect helped prevent vision loss and 
supported continued education or employment.

EYE CARE JOURNEY
In Telangana’s Ranga Reddy 
district, a 9th-grade student 
underwent an eye screening 
using the SightConnect app at 
ZPHS Kandukur school. When the 
test indicated a vision issue, she 
informed her parents, who then 
accessed her test results through 
the app. With the in-app referral, 
they visited a nearby eye hospital 
where she was diagnosed and 
prescribed spectacles. This early 
intervention helped her regain clear 
vision and continue her studies 
without hindrance.

EYE CARE EXPERIENCE
During a student screening at ZPHS 
Vamsoor in Khammam district, the 
class assistant decided to test his 
own vision using SightConnect. 
The app flagged an urgent need 
for consultation. Following its 
guidance, he visited the L V Prasad 
Eye Institute where he received a 
prescription for spectacles and 
eye drops. The treatment greatly 
improved his vision, and he 
expressed heartfelt gratitude for 
the technology that helped restore 
his sight.

HEADMASTER INITIATIVE FOR 
STUDENTS
After screenings revealed vision 
issues among students at ZPHS 
Kandukur, the Headmaster took 
proactive steps to ensure their 
well-being. Using the SightConnect 
app, he identified students 
needing immediate attention and 
personally accompanied them to 
a local eye camp. Thanks to his 
initiative and the app's guidance, 
eight students received spectacles, 
improving their ability to engage 
fully in classroom learning.

Digital cornea bank
Extending this mission further, Infosys is pioneering 
a digital cornea bank, a transformative step toward 
optimizing cornea preservation and distribution. 
Powered by Agentic AI, this smart system is 
designed to significantly reduce cornea wastage 

and ensure more donated corneas reach patients 
in need. By digitizing and intelligently managing 
the corneal transplant process, Infosys is not just 
innovating in healthcare, but driving meaningful 
impact in the fight against corneal blindness.

Nurturing Workplace Inclusivity

At Infosys, we envision a future where diversity, equity, and inclusion power innovation, growth, and shared success 
across the world. We are committed to building and sustaining a workplace where every individual is respected, 
empowered, and given equal opportunity to thrive. Rooted in our Code of Conduct and Ethics, and guided by the 
principle of 'Respecting Each Other,' our vision for inclusivity is not just a value we uphold, it is a catalyst for taking 
everyone forward together.

39% women in 
the workforce

Inclusion and innovation
We believe inclusion is a strategic advantage to 
any organization. A diverse workforce brings richer 
perspectives, fuels creativity, strengthens problemsolving, and drives deeper connection. Diversity 
drives innovation and innovation drives Infosys.

Our commitment is to create a gender-diverse 
workforce at Infosys, with 45% women by 2030 
In 2025, this stands at 39%.

Our approach
At Infosys, our inclusion strategy is built on a simple 
yet powerful belief. The solutions we create must 
reflect the diversity of the customers we serve. 
To truly understand and meet the needs of a 
global client base, we are committed to building 
an equally diverse and inclusive workforce. By 
cultivating an environment where different 
perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences are 
valued, we enhance our ability to innovate, solve 

complex challenges, and deliver transformative 
outcomes for our clients around the world. In today’s 
interconnected world, not embracing inclusivity 
is a missed opportunity, becoming a significant 
business risk, impacting our ability to stay relevant, 
competitive, and resilient. 

Our inclusion strategy is anchored in strong 
governance and data-driven leadership.

• Inclusion governance structure: Our goals are 
integrated into the corporate scorecard and 
cascaded in order to ensure accountability across 
levels. Our Inclusion Councils, established globally, 
across geographies, business units, and locations, 
create a powerful matrix of collaboration and 
ownership. These councils, composed of leaders 
from both business and enabling functions, are 
designed to address strategic priorities while 
being responsive to local diversity needs. Periodic 
reviews strengthen the impact and agility of our 
inclusion efforts.

• Data-driven inclusion leadership: The Infosys 
Inclusion Leadership Tool provides real-time, 

24/7 access to data, empowering business and 
HR leaders to make informed, timely decisions 
regarding hiring, growth, and retention of 
diverse talent. This tool enhances visibility to 
accelerate action, and ensures that inclusion 
progress is measurable, transparent, and 
continuously evolving.

A culture of inclusion
At Infosys, inclusion is a living part of our culture, 
embedded in how we lead, learn, and grow 
together. Guided by the principle of ‘Respecting 
Each Other’, our goals are integrated into leadership 
KPIs, supported by multi-level Inclusion Councils, 
and reinforced through our learning platform LEX, 
which offers a multitude of resources on inclusion. 
Real-time sentiment tracking through Pulse ensures 
employee voices are heard and acted upon, 
while communities like IWIN and campaigns like 
#ThriveAtInfosys fosters belonging and challenges 
biases. From inclusive infrastructure to flexible 
policies and cultural celebrations, every touchpoint 
at Infosys reflects our deep commitment to 
building a workplace where everyone feels valued, 
empowered, and included.

Women at Infosys
Empowering women is a critical pillar of our 
commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. As a 
proud signatory to the UN Women’s Empowerment

Through our Restart with Infosys program, we 
are committed to welcoming back talented 
professionals who have taken a career break. The 
program offers a structured learning platform and 
mentorship support to help them transition back 
into the workforce with confidence. In fiscal 2025 
alone, 935 women rejoined the corporate world

implement several initiatives to propel women into 
leadership roles.
• #IamtheFuture: A flagship program designed to 
prepare women for senior leadership roles. Over 
200 women leaders enhanced competencies

designed to propel women into leadership roles 
within the technology and business sectors. This 
comprehensive initiative goes beyond just skill 
development. It fosters a supportive ecosystem 
where women can sharpen their technical and 
business acumen, develop leadership skills, and 
build valuable networks through mentorship 
opportunities, workshops, and networking events, 
participants connect with established leaders 
and build a strong support network within the 
organization. This fosters a sense of community 
and provides access to invaluable guidance and 
career development resources. Over 400 women 
enrolled in its third cohort across India, EMEA, and 
APAC. 1,278 women have completed the program 
since its inception in FY2023. 47% of them have 
advanced to the next role.

resources and three certifications, ranging from 
basic to advanced levels. To date, more than 22,300 
Infoscions have completed their ABD learning 
journeys, enhancing our collective ability to build 
accessible experiences for all.

We continue to champion a barrier-free workplace 
through curated e-learning courses that educate 
employees on the various types of disabilities and 
the practical steps needed to create accessible and 
inclusive environments. 

Accessibility Living Lab
Infosys Accessibility Living Lab is a unique learning 
space to experience digital accessibility firsthand. 
Through simulated interactions and real-world 
scenarios, the lab fosters empathy and awareness 
of accessibility challenges, introduces users to 
assistive technology and facilitates the creation of 
digitally accessible solutions. The lab also features 
Infosys Accessibility Platform, an AI-first, cloud-ready 

designed to drive greater inclusion and create 

opportunities for women in the workplace.

Employees with disabilities

Our commitment to enabling employees is deeply 
woven into our diversity, equity, and inclusion 
strategy, driving us to create barrier-free, accessible, 
and empowering environments across all our 
workplaces. There are 1,095 employees who 
have voluntarily declared disabilities, as on 
March 31, 2025.

Focused hiring and retention
Our targeted hiring and retention initiatives for 
employees with disabilities have yielded positive 
results, reinforcing our belief that diversity 
strengthens our business and our culture. Through 
structured programs and ongoing support, we are 
creating pathways for individuals with disabilities to 
thrive and grow within Infosys.

#AccessibleByDesign
We are fostering a culture of inclusion through our 
AccessibleByDesign (ABD) campaign, that raises 
awareness and builds critical skills for designing and 
implementing inclusive software and solutions. To 
support continuous learning, we have developed 
a dedicated digital Accessibility Learning Channel 
on our internal platform, LEX, featuring over 60 

accessibility, and inclusivity solution with a patented 
audit tool to identify and address accessibility gaps 
and AI-based functions to confirm inclusivity.

Creating opportunities beyond the 
workplace
Our support extends beyond the corporate walls. 
With a focus on livelihood development for persons 
with disabilities, we proudly restarted the MITTI 

Café at our Bengaluru Development Center (DC), 
a venture that provides dignified employment 
opportunities and fosters greater inclusion within 
our workplace communities.

Partnerships to empower talent

Microsoft Enabler Program, we participated in the 
Prepare for Employment Program (PEP), offering 

43 | External Document © 2025 Infosys Limited 

training and mentorship to students, job seekers, 
and early-career individuals with disabilities. In 
the first PEP batch, 100+ mentees benefitted from 
workshops and mentoring focused on critical 
career readiness and technical skills.

LGBTQIA+

Fostering a workplace where every individual can 
thrive, irrespective of gender identity or sexual 
orientation, is core to our vision of an inclusive, 
forward-looking organization. As a signatory to 
the UN Free & Equal campaign, we reaffirm our 
commitment to building an environment where 
members of the LGBTQIA+ community feel seen, 
respected, and empowered.

Creating a culture of awareness and allyship
Our journey of inclusion is rooted in education 
and advocacy. We create allyship through three 
specialized learning modules on our Inclusion 
Learning Channel. These modules equip employees 
with knowledge, empathy, and actionable tools 
to become better allies and champions for the 
LGBTQIA+ community.

We also amplify voices from within and beyond the 
organization. Personal stories, blogs, and expert 
interviews featuring well-known personalities from 
the LGBTQIA+ community are hosted regularly on our 
Inclusion Learning Channel, fostering understanding, 
connection, and celebration of diverse experiences.

Building inclusive infrastructure & policies
In fiscal 2025, Infosys introduced inclusive restrooms 
across all India campuses, taking a tangible step 
toward making our physical spaces welcoming and 
safe for all gender identities. Recognizing the unique 
experiences and challenges faced by transgender 
individuals, we have also launched specialized

Embracing multiculturalism and 
multigenerational diversity
Beyond gender identity, we are committed to 
embracing the full spectrum of human diversity. 
Recognizing the evolving demographics of our 
workforce, we introduced new courses to sensitize 
employees about working across different cultures 
and generations. These initiatives help foster 
mutual respect, enhance collaboration, and ensure 
that our workplace thrives on the rich tapestry of 
perspectives brought by employees from varied 
backgrounds, experiences, and age groups.

Employee Resource Groups
Beyond leadership commitment and policy, there 
is a larger focus on where employees experience 
inclusion in their everyday workplace, interacting 
with colleagues and immediate teams. To 
strengthen these micro ecosystems, Employee 
Resource Groups (ERGs) act as huge enablers. 

ERGs, including allies, provide a safe and supportive 
space within Infosys where employees can connect 
and foster a sense of belonging. The perspectives 
and ideas shared within these groups are taken 
seriously and thoughtfully considered. Infosys is 
committed to ensuring that every employee feels 
supported and valued by the organization.

Infosys Foundation
Established in 1996, Infosys Foundation supports 
programs in the areas of education and skill 
development to enable sustained livelihoods, 
healthcare, women empowerment, and 
environmental sustainability, amongst others. Its 
mission is to work with the underprivileged across 
the country and strive towards a more equitable 
society. Infosys Foundation takes pride in working 
with all sections of society, selecting projects 
with infinite care, and working in areas that are 
traditionally overlooked by society at large.

Healthcare interventions are focused on bringing 
critical services to India’s grassroots along with 
strengthening accessible healthcare institutions 
with state-of-the-art infrastructure. Hospitals and 
institutes like Madras Medical College, Sri Sathya 
Sai Sarla Memorial Hospital, LV Prasad Eye Institute 
(LVPEI) among others have benefited from focused 
interventions from the Foundation. Through our 
community-based health projects led by Sangath, 
Banyan, The Antara Foundation, Centre for Cellular 
and Molecular Platforms (CCAMP) and KEM Pune, 
we provide focused healthcare to marginalized 
communities especially women in tribal areas and 
difficult to reach geographies.

Education initiatives are focused on bridging the 
gap between education and employability by 
making in-demand skills accessible to learners with 
free platforms like Infosys Springboard. We have 
specialized programs making STEM education

with migrant backgrounds are provided language 
classes with childcare. After school, girls are tutored 
one-on-one with sustainability, empowerment and 
participation at the focus.

The holidays are a great time to give back and 
raise awareness about our fellow Frankfurt 
community. Many families are unfamiliar with and 
underequipped to face the cold weather, especially 
during their first winter in Germany. By collecting 
gently worn jackets and winter items, in addition to 
school supplies, hygiene items and non-perishable 
items, we supported the families of MBM in a 
meaningful way. Since the drive in December 2024, 
multiple colleagues have come forward to support 
the MBM.

Designing world-class employee experiences 

We strive to create a world-class employee experience by designing consistent best-in-class policies, processes, programs, and systems, focusing on creating ‘Experience by 
Design’ while keeping employees at the core of whatever we do. We gather employee feedback using robust listening mechanisms, built in through the employee life cycle 
to help improve our offerings and create positive memorable moments that matter using technology. Some of our interventions across the employee life cycle include.

InfyMe 
Our mobile-first, self-service platform integrates over 200 service touchpoints into a single, intuitive interface. InfyMe is designed to be seamlessly contextual, aiding 
networking and collaboration among our employees anytime, anywhere. We continue to enrich our InfyMe app with more services that enable teams to operate, 
connect, collaborate easily, particularly in the hybrid work model. 

AI in employee experience 
At Infosys, we recognize that each employee 
is unique, and so should be their journey 
within the organization. In today’s digitalfirst world, we are harnessing the power of 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) to deliver personalized 
experiences at scale. In line with this, we 
are reimagining the employee experience 
by integrating AI across the entire talent 
lifecycle from recruitment and onboarding 
to performance management and continuous 
learning till offboarding. Our AI-powered 
recruitment capabilities streamline candidate 
screening, dynamically match talent with 
open roles, and enable intelligent interview 
scheduling. Innovations like facial recognition 
and compliance-driven checks enhance security 
and integrity in the hiring process. We have also 
introduced intelligent job recommendation 
features on our career platforms, helping 
candidates discover relevant opportunities 
based on their unique skills and experience.

For new joinees, in onboarding, initiatives 
such as Infosys Immerse in the metaverse, 
AI-powered assistants, and smart identity 
verification tools are shaping seamless, 
engaging entry experiences. Employees benefit 
from AI-driven assistants like NAVI, which 
handle queries, support transactions, and offer 
tailored policy guidance, reducing reliance on 
helpdesks while enhancing personalization. 

Some of our NAVI powered interventions, we 
have already implemented at Infosys are:

• Data Assist: This AI assistant can be used 

to query data related to Leave, Attendance, 
Allocation, Assets, Confirmation, Master data 
etc., of self and the team. It avoids the need to 
go to multiple systems. Data can be queried 
in natural language making it easy for the 
manager.

 • Policy Advisor: Revolutionizing the way, 
employees interact with HR for various 
services. For instance, the AI Assistant will 

respond to employee queries by interpreting 
policy documents and personalize interactions 
based on an individual employee. The Navi 
orchestrator merges multiple domain advisors 
into a single interface, routing employee 
queries to the appropriate advisors. The 
advanced AI algorithm personalizes responses 
based on employee profiles, ensuring program 
effectiveness. This will in turn help reduce 
queries going to our helpdesk and directly to 
HR as well.

• Moments That Matter (MTM): Every 

employee has significant moments that 
create substantial impact on their overall 
satisfaction and well-being, during their 
organizational experience. MTM has been 
ideated to become a celebration platform 
which will be integrated into all celebrations, 
small or big, throughout the employee life 
cycle. Smart alerts inform employees on 
upcoming moments that matter in their team 
and they can use AI to generate cards and 
messages to their colleagues and teams. 

For managers and leaders, AI tools enable intuitive 
access to data, proactive nudges, and insights that 
support informed, empathetic decision-making. 
Our AI-driven pulse analysis also empowers 
continuous listening, helping us identify employee 
sentiment and act early to enhance well-being and 
engagement.

In learning and development, we are deploying 
generative AI to deliver personalized learning paths, 
simulate real-world scenarios, and assist in content 
creation. AI companions on our learning platform 
Lex, such as Zoiee and SynthAIz, provide intelligent 
tutoring, summarization, and contextual learning 
support. These innovations ensure every employee 
receives guidance aligned to their goals, skill levels, 
and preferred learning styles. From automated 
offboarding to retention analysis, AI also supports 
thoughtful transitions while maintaining a human 
touch. Our vision remains clear: to responsibly use 
AI not as a replacement, but as a powerful enabler 
enhancing personalization, improving operational 
agility, and reinforcing our commitment to a 
people-first, future-ready workplace.

capital in the workplace by fostering friendships 
among colleagues. The goal is twofold: to promote 
connectedness and to encourage the formation of 
new bonds within the workplace.

Infyusion
This innovative program brings together finalists 
from various segments of sports and culture, creating

Career growth and learning avenues 
Learning and Career
LnC portal is a one-stop solution for employees' 
learning and career needs. Over the past year, it was 
redesigned to offer a more personalized experience, 
featuring the new Career Canvas. This consolidates 
multiple career avenues—IJPs, projects, and bridge 
programs—into one view, helping employees 
identify next-role possibilities, assess skill gaps, and 
receive personalized learning recommendations. 
65% to 70% of open positions are filled through IJPs 
facilitating growth for employees. 

Capability Quotient (CQ)
Capability Quotient is a comprehensive framework 
that integrates technology skills, domain skills, 
foundational skills, and social skills to enable 
employees’ holistic development. This enhanced 
skills framework fosters adaptability and ensures a 
sustainable competitiveness in a rapidly evolving 
landscape. Employees can increase their CQ by 
gaining knowledge, building experience and 
expertise, track their skill development journey 
and get feedback on these skills through learning 
resources, endorsements, and manager evaluations. 
Employees with a higher CQ have greater access to 
new opportunities and interesting projects. CQ is 
planned to be rolled out, effective July 1, 2025. 

The Platinum Club
The club is a niche experience created for our top 
performers. Members of this club are selected with 
great rigor and objectivity through a two-pronged 
approach of high performance and high capabilities 
(measured through consistent ratings and high DQ). 
The program ensures that there are diverse career 
experiences, faster growth trajectory, differentiated 
rewards and higher visibility for those who are 
identified as platinum club members.

Great Managers, Great Teams
The Infosys Great Manager Program
Now in its third year, the Infosys Great 
Manager Program is designed to nurture 
future-ready leadership. Delivered in 
collaboration with Cornell University, this 
fully digital, self-paced learning journey 
builds core managerial competencies 
such as business acumen, a digital-first 
mindset, people leadership, and operational 
excellence. Through concise and impactful 
modules from eCornell, managers are 
empowered to lead with insight, agility, and 
purpose.

The Manager Code
To guide and anchor our managerial 
culture, we introduced the Manager’s 
Code, a behavioral blueprint for people 
management at Infosys. It serves as a clear 
reference point for all managers, aligning 
expectations and promoting consistent 
leadership behaviors across the organization.

Recognizing Managerial Excellence
We also celebrate our best managers 
across the organization every quarter. 
These recognitions are based on careful 
consideration of multiple data points, 
including performance metrics, employee 
satisfaction scores, employee feedback, 
people connect initiatives, and individual 
learning journeys. This holistic evaluation 
ensures we spotlight managers who 
consistently demonstrate excellence in both 
results and people leadership.

Performance management
Our Performance Management Process is a 
cornerstone of our talent strategy, built on the 
principles of rewarding performance, fostering a 
culture of continuous development, and skillbased growth. In alignment with our vision 
of becoming a Skill-Driven Organization, the 
performance management process now integrates 
skill identification and skill proficiency assessment 
as core components of both goal setting and 
performance evaluation. These inputs form the 
basis for personalized skill journeys and individual 
development plans, ensuring that each employee 
is equipped to grow in line with both personal 
aspirations and organizational needs. 
Goal setting within our process follows the SMART 
framework and is cascaded top-down to ensure 
alignment with organizational and team objectives. 
The process encourages a balance between 
individual and team goals, fostering collaboration 
and shared accountability. 
Evaluation is supported by a multi-level approval 
workflow involving the appraiser (manager), 
reviewer (manager’s manager), and approving 
authority (Department/Function Head). Additionally, 
we have introduced many features to aid 
360-degree feedback. 
Consultant evaluation where specific goals can 
be assessed by cross-functional managers reflecting 
workforce mobility and dynamic role structure @
Infosys. 
Delegate manager evaluation which allows 
supervisors closely working with employees to 
provide first-level feedback. 
The process is tailored to different organizational 
levels, with an annual cycle for Individual 
Contributors (ICs) and First-Level People Managers. 
To further support the IC stream, we have 
institutionalized a Quarterly Check-ins program 
that promotes ongoing dialogue around skill 
development, aspiration management, goal

progress, and employee engagement. A Bi-annual 
cycle for Middle Managers enabling agile and 
responsive performance and talent management 
interventions. The annual cycle for Senior Leaders is 
designed to provide the necessary time horizon for 
these leaders to execute their strategic long-term 
vision and deliver sustained outcomes. 
To ensure timely and unbiased evaluations, 
the system supports rolling goal assessments 
throughout the year, particularly aligned with 
project closures. This helps mitigate recency bias 
and ensures that performance is evaluated in realtime. For Middle Managers and Senior Leaders, most 
goals are automated, with actuals auto fetched from 
internal systems. This automation enhances data 
integrity and minimizes human error.
The future is led from within
Infosys Leadership Institute 
With AI playing a pivotal role in the next phase 
of transformation of organizations, the Infosys 
Leadership Institute (ILI) partnered with Kellogg 
to bring their highly acclaimed program on AI 
Applications of Growth to all its leaders. In FY25, 
over 1000 senior leaders of Infosys completed 
this certification program and most of them also 
participated in a live discussion with the author of 
this course, Prof. Mohanbir Sawhney. This includes 
about 250 women leaders, with many of them also 
working on AI related projects and initiatives. 
ILI strengthened the succession program by 
broadening its focus to key roles in business 
and enabling functions, and creating highly 
personalized development programs for the 
incumbents and successors in organizational 
critical positions. The highly successful successionenabling Constellation program aimed at high 
potential emerging leaders, was expanded and 
paired with a 10-month curated program with 
Oxford University. The Constellation leaders 
also commenced work on cross-functional, 
strategic organizational projects, to bolster their 
enterprise leadership, thus preparing them for 

senior leadership positions. Broader leadership 
development and engagement continue with 
signature programs like the 10-month Enterprise 
Leadership program in partnership thus preparing 
them for senior leadership positions.Broader 
leadership development and engagement with 
multiple universities including Kellogg, Tuck, NUS, 
and the 6-month long Executive Presence and 
Presentation program in partnership with The 
Economist. More than 2000 one-on-one leadership 
advisory discussions were completed by ILI with 
leaders, focused on their leadership development 
plan. With more than 97% leaders completing 
a significant development intervention, Infosys 
leaders invested 10,500+ leadership learning days 
equivalent on their development.

Leadership diversity continues to be important 
for Infosys and the acclaimed ILI #IamtheFuture 
program saw more than 200 women leaders 
completing a development program addressing 
critical and differentiating competencies needed 
for success and growth. About 100 women 
leaders completed a program with Stanford on 
Executive Communication, supported by oneon-one coaching from a global communications 
firm. Career conversations were completed for 
critical and high-potential women leaders across 
segments and delivery, and 200+ women leaders 
completed a development coaching conversation 
with internal leadership advisors. 

Our relentless focus on leadership development 
and engagement continues to set us up well for 
the future.

Employee satisfaction
Infosys has a robust mechanism to gauge 
employee sentiments and feedback through its 
Pulse survey. This tool collects ongoing and realtime feedback from employees anonymously on 

key organization-wide themes that shape their 
experience, including work learning and careers 
through a micro survey every quarter.We also poll 
our employees on select tenure-based milestones 
and specific events. This cumulative understanding 
of employee perception, and feedback from actual 
events and milestones have strengthened our 
sensing architecture to obtain richer insights of 
employee experiences. To drive change across 
the organization, all managers have access to a 
real-time customized dashboard with feedback 
from their respective teams, which enables them 
to engage with their teams better and address any 
concerns. This dashboard has multiple views and 
advanced analytics such as heatmaps, trendlines, 
and sentiment analytics to enable the managers to 
prioritize focus areas according to their teams. 

Employee satisfaction
(ESAT) for FY25: 77%

This comprehensive ESAT result is based on 
feedback gathered across 22 distinct themes, with 
high scores in key areas such as Job Satisfaction 
(77%), Purpose (85%), HappinessSense of 
Connectedness (87%) & Well-being Support (84%), 
Career & Learning (84%) and Innovation(80%). 

The company's commitment to acting on feedback 
is evident in the 82% Employee Listening score. 
This high score indicates that employees feel 
their feedback is not only valued but also leads to 
meaningful action, fostering a culture of trust and 
continuous improvement. 

Attrition score remains low at 14% when compared 
to the pre-COVID period (18%).

Upholding values and rights

At Infosys, purposeful work begins with a foundation of integrity. We believe that for people to truly find 
meaning in what they do, they must first feel safe, respected, and valued. Upholding dignity, fairness, and 
trust in every interaction is not just a responsibility, it is essential to enabling purpose, building belonging and 
sustaining a culture where every individual can thrive.

Resolution hubs
Infosys is committed to providing a safe and positive 
work environment. In keeping with this philosophy, 
the organization envisages an open-door policy 
and encourages a culture of “speak up”. Employees 
also have access to several forums where they can 
highlight matters or concerns faced at the workplace 
for effective remediation. This is achieved through 
a well-established and robust grievance resolution 
mechanism comprising resolution hubs. Resolution 
hubs adhere to the principles of natural justice, 
confidentiality, sensitivity, non-retaliation and 
fairness, while addressing concerns. The concerns are 
handled objectively while ensuring timely action and 
closure. In matters that entail a detailed investigation, 
the process ensures fairness for all involved, with 
an opportunity to be heard, present facts and any 
material evidence before a neutral panel.

HEAR
Infosys has a robust grievance redressal forum called 
HEAR (Hearing Employees And Resolving) fostering 
healthy employee relations and a positive work 
environment by giving our employees a neutral 
platform ‘to be heard’ and building the culture of 

‘speak up’. Employees can raise a complaint on the 
HEAR webapp or InfyMe mobile application or write 
to HEAR@infosys.com. HEAR adopts a decentralized 
model and addresses employee concerns in a 
structured manner with appellate forums for 
workplace grievances that have not been duly heard 
at the preliminary level by the Managers (or) line HR.

ASHI
The Company’s assurance to its employees of 
providing a harassment-free workplace is reflected 
in our key initiative, ASHI (Anti-Sexual Harassment 
Initiative). As per the Prevention of Sexual Harassment 
Act in India, the Company has constituted Internal 
Committees (IC) in all the development centers with 
the ambit of the regulatory jurisdiction, for redressal 
of sexual harassment matters reported by women 
employees. We also have a strong governance 
mechanism in the form of GRB (Grievance Redressal 
Body) to define, interpret and implement Company’s 
policy on prevention of sexual harassment at the 
workplace. GRB consists of external members, 
internal senior members, and the Investigative 
Council. Here, we follow a gender-neutral approach in 
redressal of all such complaints. Complaints are taken 

Transition assistance: We provide employees opportunities to upgrade their skills as part of transition assistance to 
facilitate their continued employability and the management of career endings resulting from termination of employment.

The Employee Career Support program: Retirement Planning spans a portfolio of services including consultations from 
retirement specialists, strategic financial planning, retirement focused roadmap and resources, careers workshops, and 
access to networking groups dedicated to retirement options.

up for a formal redressal process in line with the POSH 
Act and the Company’s policy on anti-harassment as 
applicable. The reports on ASHI grievances can be 
shared to GRB@infosys.com and employees can also 
report complaints on the ASHI webapp or InfyMe 
mobile application.

Extending the initiative to contract staff
Our commitment to a positive and safe working 
environment is not restricted only to our employees, 
but also third parties, who provide services in our 
campuses. We conduct refresher sessions for such 
third-party employees to reinforce the message. 
These sessions are covered in nine vernacular 
languages in India currently. Emergency / safety 
cards with important contact numbers are also 
handed over to all Infosys employees and employees 
of such third parties. All our security personnel are 
trained in human rights policies and procedures.

Whistleblower Policy
The Company has formulated the Whistleblower 
Policy in line with the mandated regulatory 
requirements – Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), 2002 
& Companies Act, 2013 – which mandates listed 
companies to establish a “vigil mechanism” for 
reporting genuine concerns.

The forum is predominantly for the receipt, retention 
and treatment of complaints regarding matters 
of probable discrepancies in accounting, internal 
accounting controls or auditing, and also enables 
anonymous reporting by employees. While the 
Whistleblower Policy and the forum is administered 
and managed by the Office of Integrity and 
Compliance, complaints (anonymous or otherwise) 
pertaining to deviations in workplace policies / 
processes involving employees are reviewed in 
tandem by the Employee Relations Department.

Human Rights is an important area of focus in the 
annual integrated assessments conducted by the 
internal Corporate Certifications and Audits Team 
(CCAT). The assessment references GRI, SA8000, 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and 
the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report

ESG Governance 
In October 2020, we launched our ESG Vision 
2030. Our focus has been steadfast on leveraging 
technology to battle climate change, conserve 
water and manage waste. On the social front, 
our emphasis has been on the development of 
people, especially around digital skilling, improving 
diversity and inclusion, facilitating employee 
wellness and experience, delivering technology for 
social good and energizing the communities we 
live and work in. We have also redoubled efforts to 
serve the interests of all our stakeholders by leading 

through our core values and setting benchmarks in 
corporate governance.

Our Board instituted an ESG Committee on April 
14, 2021, to discharge its responsibility to oversee 
matters related to Infosys group-wide ESG initiatives, 
priorities, and leading ESG practices. The ESG 
Committee reports to the Board and meets every 
quarter. The ESG Council executes the programs 
and plans of the ESG Committee to achieve the 
ambitions outlined in Infosys' ESG vision 2030.

ESG Committee Charter 
The purpose of the Environmental, Social and 
Governance Committee is to assist the Board and 
the Company in fulfilling the ambitions committed 
in the ESG vision of the Company.
Read more.

The purpose of the Council is to execute the 
programs and plans of the ESG Committee to 
achieve the ambitions outlined in the ESG Vision 
2030. The Council nominates sponsors from the 
executive leadership team, who work closely with 
the ESG ambition leads to ensure progress on the 
goals. The Council has the overall responsibility 
for ESG governance, reporting, communication, 
branding, and taking stock of the performance and 
discussing programs and plans, as appropriate.

The Company receives disclosure of interest, 
including both self and relatives, at regular intervals 
from its Directors, which helps the Company identify 
the entities / bodies with which the Company 

has a conflict of interest. The same is addressed in 
accordance with policies of the Company. 

We have a structured governance mechanism to 
communicate critical concerns of stakeholders to 
the highest governing body, for review and due 
action. A multi-layer governance structure is in 
place to monitor and report risk and risk mitigation 
activities, including those of ESG. 

Our Enterprise Risk Management framework 
encompasses all the Company’s risks – strategy 
and strategy execution; operational; and legal and 
compliance risks. Any of these categories can have 
internal or external dimensions. The systematic 
and proactive identification of risks, and mitigation 
thereof, enables our organization to boost 
performance with effective and timely decisionmaking. Strategic decisions are taken after careful 
consideration of primary risks, secondary risks, 
consequential risks and residual risks.

The risk management committee assists the Board 
in fulfilling its corporate governance oversight 
responsibilities with regard to the identification, 
evaluation and mitigation of strategic, operational, 
and external environment risks. A robust complaints 
management system ensures that all complaints are 
addressed effectively. 
Read more.

Stakeholder engagement is delegated to identified 
heads of departments and feedback from these 
engagements are discussed through a review of 
performance on our ESG ambitions as a part of the 
quarterly ESG Committee meetings.

Advisory Services (IiAS)

Our grievance redressal mechanisms are articulated 
in the Infosys Code of Conduct and Ethics including 

62 | External Document © 2025 Infosys Limited 

a Whistleblower mechanism with non-retaliatory 
clauses for all stakeholders. Additionally, employees 
and contractual staff have access to robust 
resolution hubs. Suppliers are advised of grievance 
redressal mechanisms through the Supplier Code of 
Conduct which they mandatorily sign.

The ESG Committee reviews client engagements 
relating to climate action and sustainability efforts 
through the Company’s sustainability offerings and 
solutions. It also reviews compliance with climate 
change regulations across various jurisdictions, 
applicable to the Company.

Interaction with other Board committees
The ESG Committee works closely with other 
Board committees to further our ESG ambitions. 
For instance, it informs ESG risks and challenges, if 
any, in achieving progress on the goals, to the Risk 
Management Committee and seeks its support to 
address the risks.

It interacts with the Stakeholder’s Relationship 
Committee to discuss performance on ESG 
assessments and actions for improvements related 
to the Company’s ESG performance from the 
security-holder’s perspective. 

It collaborates with the CSR Committee to align CSR 
initiatives with ESG ambitions. 

It also interacts with the Cybersecurity Risk Subcommittee as part of its efforts to track progress on 
the information security and data privacy ambitions. 

In addition to the ESG Committee, other Board 
committees and senior management are also 
actively involved in enhancing our performance 
and disclosures on a range of ESG topics relating 

to our different stakeholder groups. Specific cases 
of acquisitions, important managerial decisions, 
material positive / negative developments and 
statutory matters are presented to the committees 
of the Board and later, with the recommendation of 
the committees, to the Board for its approval. 
Refer to Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25. 

The Company has a robust related-parties 
governance framework to ensure that there are 
no conflicts of interest situations or transactions. 
During FY 2025, all transactions were reviewed in 
accordance with the related-parties transactions 
governance framework and appropriate approvals 
were sought, where required.

ESG performance evaluation 
ESG goals are a part of the corporate scorecard 
and the ESG performance parameters of leaders 
are cascaded to various levels in the organization. 
ESG performance of the Company is linked to the 
compensation of the CEO & MD and other leaders. 
Read more in the Corporate Governance Report.

To improve the effectiveness of the Board and 
its committees, as well as that of each individual 
director, a formal and rigorous Board evaluation is 
conducted annually through a leadership advisory 
firm – Egon Zehnder. The details are available in 
the Corporate governance report that is part of the 
Infosys Integrated Annual Report. 

Board Accountability
The Company ensures the accountability of its 
board of directors through various measures 
including stipulating average Board meeting

Building sustainable and responsible supply chains

Our upstream value chain consists of more than 
9,000 suppliers across three categories – suppliers 
of people, suppliers of products and suppliers of 
services. Supplier relationships include longterm, 
short-term, contractual, and project-based 
relationships. Our procurement from MSMEs 
amounted to 9.7% of our overall spend. The entities 
downstream from us are our clients. We serve a 
variety of clients across diverse industries ranging 
from aerospace, automobile, financial services, 
healthcare, life sciences, utilities and more. For more 
information, read Business Consulting Services and 
Technology Services offered at Infosys.

Infosys believes in and is committed to partnering 
with the highest quality suppliers to ensure that 
we deliver best-of-breed business and IT solutions 
to our clients. As a signatory to the United Nations 
Global Compact (UNGC), Infosys leverages the 
UNGC principles covering human rights, labor, 
environment, and anti-corruption as foundational 
principles for building and improving its sustainable 
supply chain practices. The Company’s Responsible 
Supply Chain and Supplier Diversity Policy is an 
expression of our commitment to integrate these 
principles into our supply chain relationships and 
towards building long-term environmental, social, 
and economic opportunities for diverse businesses. 
This commitment is manifested in our internal 
activities and processes, as well as through the 
organizations we engage with externally. Integrity 
and ethics govern all our supplier partnerships, 
while also supporting and encouraging the 
aspirations of diverse businesses.

Infosys Supplier Code of Conduct
Infosys is proud of the way it conducts its business 
and has always been a Company with a strong 

63 | External Document © 2025 Infosys Limited 

commitment to ethical business practices and 
sustainability. We encourage our suppliers to join in 
this commitment, based on a shared set of values 
and principles. We pursue mutually beneficial 
relationships with our suppliers and seek to work 
with businesses that are committed to act fairly and 
with integrity towards their stakeholders, observing 
the applicable rules of law. The Supplier Code of 
Conduct (SCoC) draws inspiration from the Infosys 
Code of Conduct and Ethics and the principles of 
the UNGC. It provides a detailed account of material 
topics that we are focused on to nurture and sustain 
responsible supply chains. As part of the onboarding 
process, all vendors must accept the Infosys SCoC. 
This is tracked diligently by the procurement team. 
Violations to the Supplier Code, can be reported 
through http://oic.infosys.com and the Infosys 
Helpline numbers, whistleblower@infosys.com 
and vendorincident@infosys.com. There were no 
supplier complaints in fiscal 2025.

Screening before empanelment
All our new suppliers go through an online ESG 
assessment through a third party tool as part of 
the pre-contracting process. The assessment 
covers publicly available information on sanctions, 
corruption, financial crimes, and litigations as 
part of the Governance dimension of ESG. Once 
this assessment is complete and there are no 
adverse findings, suppliers indicate through 
our ESG questionnaire whether they have ESG 
practices in their organizations covering social and 
environmental dimensions. If they respond in the 
affirmative, we invite them to share their ESG related 
information on social and environmental practices. 
In FY 2025, we onboarded 2015 new suppliers. 
38% of our new suppliers have responded to our 
ESG questionnaire on social and environmental 

practices as part of the onboarding process. The 
rest 68% have been invited to log into our ESG 
learning portal (Wingspan) and avail of the learning 
resources we have provided. This strategy is in line 
with our intent to strengthen ESG awareness and 
practice among our suppliers. Additionally, if a new 
supplier is part of our Top 75% spend, they will 
also undergo an assessment on ESG performance 
through a third party provider. We also support 
their 'improvement' journey through sharing best 
practices and helping them engage with specialists 
we have identified for this purpose. In line with our 
statutory reporting requirements in the BRSR, we 
conduct these assessments for the top 75% spend 
suppliers annually. 

Local procurement 
Our centralized procurements are in India, but 
we engage with local suppliers for local needs 
across geographies. We track and report diverse 
spends and make this information available to our 
clients on request. The proportion of spending on 
local suppliers was about 25.6% in fiscal 2025. We 
did not have any significant actual and potential 
negative environmental and social impacts in the 
supply chain.

Supplier engagement
Sambandh is our biannual supplier meeting. Our 
theme at Sambandh was ‘Sustainable procurement 
through engagement’. Over 700 suppliers engaged 
in Sambandh across locations in India through fiscal 
2024 and fiscal 2025. The engagement included 
workshops and discussions on the principles 
contained in the Infosys SCoC and ESG-compliant 
procurement practices.

273 suppliers engaged 
to enhance their climate 
performance

ESG assessments 
As of fiscal 2025, we have covered 800+ supplier 
groups through ESG assessments. The assessments 
cover governance, ethics and compliance with law, 
fair business practices, labor practices and human 
rights, health and safety, and environment. The 
assessment is based on a protocol which leverages 
the Infosys SCoC, ISO 26000, Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI), United Nations Human Rights 
Council (UNHRC), Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) and 
other international frameworks. The Infosys SCoC 
leverages the UNGC principles including protecting 
and upholding internationally proclaimed human 
rights, treating all persons with respect and dignity 
while safeguarding their rights, the elimination of 
forced and compulsory labor, the abolition of child 
labor in the supply chain and strong corporate 
governance practices including anti-corruption and 
anti-bribery and promoting fair business practices 
across the supply chain. During the assessment no 
actual and potential negative environmental and 
social impact was identified in the supply chain.

Deepening our responsible supply chain 
commitment 
In fiscal 2025, we onboarded a third-party 
managed services provider to help assess our 
suppliers and guide their efforts in incorporating 
responsible business practices in their 
organizations. This program includes supplier 
assessments on a globally consistent framework 
along with industry benchmarks, supplier selfassessments through a questionnaire-led approach 
and capacity-building programs. This effort enables 
us to baseline supplier performance on ESG, 
encourage sharing of best practices and engage 
actively on improvement opportunities.

ESG learning channel for suppliers 
We launched a dedicated learning channel for our 
suppliers on Infosys Wingspan. The portal contains 
ESG learning and best practices and provides 
learners an opportunity to discuss, ideate, and 
engage on ESG topics. 

Decarbonizing the supply chain 
Infosys has been a leader in climate action for 
many years due to its bold action in mitigating 
climate change impacts. Our ambitious ESG Vision 
2030 and our goal to become climate positive in 
2030 are important actions in this endeavor. We 
have been disclosing environmental information 

ESG learning channel for Suppliers

through the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) since 
2006 and remain on CDP's leadership quadrant 
for the ninth year in a row. Our Science Based 
Target Initiative (SBTi) endeavors to reduce our 
environmental impact, mitigate risk and, promote 
environmental stewardship in our operations, 
including our supply chains. To meet these 
ambitious goals, Infosys expects its supply chain 
partners to align with the Company’s environmental 
vision and ambitions. To support our suppliers' 
efforts for early adoption, we organized in-person 
four training sessions for suppliers representing 
a large part of our capex in fiscal 2025 on climate 
change and the knowledge required to facilitate 
accurate climate change disclosures including best 
practices monitoring, maintaining, and improving 
data capture methodologies, emissions monitoring 
as well as calculation techniques applicable to the 
organization. The workshops leveraged Infosys’ 
benchmark practices in environmental sustainability 

while offering learners an opportunity to experience 
our campuses, referred to as ‘living labs’ for clean 
technologies.

Integrity and Compliance

The Ethics and Compliance Program at Infosys has two key objectives – to uphold and ensure the 
values of integrity and transparency and to assure enterprise-wide regulatory compliance. Integrity 
is key to nurturing a responsible business. Beyond regulation and stakeholder attention, there is 
a growing recognition that good behavior is good for business. Our values are the principles we 
use to run the Company daily and are the source of our Code of Conduct and Ethics. Our values 
are the foundation of everything we do and are encapsulated in the acronym C-LIFE (Client value, 
Leadership by example, Integrity and transparency, Fairness and Excellence).

Code of Conduct and Ethics
We firmly believe that following the highest 
standards of business conduct and ethics helps us 
run our business responsibly. Our Code of Conduct 
and Ethics ("the Code") helps us maintain the 
highest ethical standards in everything we do. It 
complies with the legal requirements of applicable 
laws and regulations, including antibribery and 
anti-corruption and ethical handling of conflicts 
of interest. It also highlights expectations from our 
employees. The Code is signed off by the Board 
and the Office of Integrity and Compliance is the 
custodian of the Code. Our business partners 
acknowledge and comply with the Supplier Code of 
Conduct. 

Reinforcing a culture of compliance 
Digital version of the Code 
We also have a digital version of the Code. It offers 
a user-friendly and easy-to-navigate audio-visual 
experiences that also allows access to specific topics 
in an interactive manner. The Code can be accessed 
on mobile devices as well. The digital version of the 
Code aims to help every employee understand the 
behavior we expect and the principles and values 

we uphold. We aim to continue to build a culture of 
compliance, where everyone feels they can do the 
right thing and prioritize legal and ethical choices. 

Training on the Code
Our employees and the Board members are 
trained on the Code. We have a Smart Awareness 
Quiz (SAQ), which includes training modules that 
employees are mandatorily required to undertake 
every year to renew their commitment to the Code. 
Our vendor partners were also trained on the 
Supplier Code of Conduct through various channels 
including live sessions during the vendor partner 
meet called Sambandh. We also have a detailed 
communication plan to use multiple channels of 
communication like emails, video messages, blogs, 
gamified assessments, and storyboards to spread 
awareness about various policies. 

#SwipeRightforIntegrity
#SwipeRightforIntegrity is an annual legal and 
compliance event organized by Infosys. The event 
brings together our leaders to reinforce our values 
of integrity, transparency, and good governance 

to build enduring relationships with our clients, 
employees, and partners. It has become a platform 
to create awareness and have an engaging dialogue 
with all stakeholders, and influence behavior and 
showcase the Infosys culture. 

Local Compliance Officer program 
To further raise awareness among our employees 
about ethical aspects globally, a Local Compliance 
Officer (LCO) network has also been created across 
the Infosys Group in collaboration with the Office of 
Integrity and Compliance. The LCO network plays a 
crucial role in promoting an organizational culture 
that encourages ethical conduct and a commitment 
to compliance with the law, regulations, and policies 
and helps in maximizing the impact of ethics-related 
compliance training. 

Statutory and regulatory compliance
Statutory Compliance Practice
Infosys has implemented a statutory compliance 
program covering a wide swathe of business 
enabling areas, covering units (inclusive of branches, 
subsidiaries, legal entities, etc.) across the global 
locations. This program has ensured that entities 
set up, irrespective of the location, follow the law 
of the land not just during the initial startup phase 
but on a continuous basis. Compliance obligations 
on topics around Cybersecurity, Anti-Bribery and 
Anti-Corruption, Anti-Trust, etc. are not just given 
due importance but are tracked, implemented, 
and monitored on a regular basis. The program is 
monitored on a regular basis keeping pace with the 
growth of the organization globally.

65 | External Document © 2025 Infosys Limited 

Infosys recognized by 
Ethisphere among 2025 World’s 
Most Ethical Companies® for 
the fifth consecutive year

Regulatory compliance practice
In addition to the statutory one, Infosys set up a 
regulatory compliance program to centralize, track 
and monitor the implementation of compliances 
stemming from client engagements. Industry vertical 
compliances across 19 verticals have been scoped, 
implemented, monitored for effectiveness topped 
up with an overview of new compliances and/or 
changes to the existing ones on the horizon. The 
program enabled Infosys to comply with all the 
applicable laws and regulations, ensuring adequate 
governance across the industry spectrum.

Responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI)

As a global technology leader, Infosys recognizes the 
transformative potential of AI. Our responsible AI 
framework is grounded in ethical principles: fairness, 
transparency, privacy, and accountability. We are 
dedicated to developing safe, unbiased, and humanaligned AI systems, governed by strong oversight 
mechanisms. Through ongoing stakeholder 
engagement and collaboration with global standards 
bodies, we aim to foster innovation that upholds 
public trust and protects societal well-being.

Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption (ABAC) 
practices and policy 
Our ABAC practices and policy is reviewed by the 
Management at regular intervals. With an evolving 
landscape, Infosys is committed to a responsible 
ABAC risk management framework to demonstrate 
a comprehensive risk management program 
to reduce the risks by regularly assessing risk in 
alignment with its growth strategies, and to drive 
an ethical and risk intelligent culture, to increase 
the certainty of business outcomes. Risk assessment 
for bribery and corruption is done periodically 
and the criteria used include business units / 
internal departments, location, and the Corruption 
Perception Index (CPI) of countries, among others. 

Anti-competitive practices policy 
The Anti-Trust Policy states the objective, scope, 
applicability, and regulatory consequences. 
This policy encompasses the three aspects of 
antitrust law bordering on: (i) abuse of dominance; 
(ii) antitrust; (iii) merger control. The policy is 
reviewed periodically by the Management for its 
appropriateness and applicability. In addition to the 
policy being setup, training is provided at regular 
intervals to colleagues and / or teams which form 
part of the high-risk group for better awareness. 

Export control policy 
The export control policy describes Infosys’ export 
control program and is reviewed periodically by the 
Management. The export control program protects 
the Company and its employees from potential 
risk of violation of sanctions prescribed under 
export control regulations and facilitates business 
expansion in accordance with these regulations. All 
our customers and vendors are screened against 
various sanctions to ensure that we are compliant. 

66 | External Document © 2025 Infosys Limited 

As part of the program, training modules, and 
awareness campaigns are rolled out to relevant 
employees to ensure that they are aware and are 
compliant with export control laws. We have a 
self-assessment and certification program in place 
for anti-bribery and anti-corruption, antitrust / anticompetition, and export control. 

Whistleblower policy 
The Infosys Whistleblower Policy is a comprehensive 
and well-designed mechanism that encourages 
employees, vendors, customers, and any other 
stakeholders to report any unethical conduct, 
violation of applicable laws or the Company’s 
Code of Conduct and Ethics occurring within the 
Company. With strict confidentiality measures and 
multiple reporting channels, the policy ensures that 
whistleblowers are protected from any retaliation. The 
Company reviews all complaints impartially and takes 
appropriate action, as applicable, while providing 
regular communication to ensure awareness 
about the policy. The Infosys Whistleblower Policy 
is a testament to the Company’s commitment 
to transparency, accountability, and responsible 
corporate citizenship. 

Use of technology for effective compliance 
monitoring of controls 
We have leveraged Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 
Machine Learning (ML) technology to review and 
identify exceptions in compliance and Anti-Bribery 
and Anti-Corruption controls. 

Compliance proof-testing
Infosys implemented a statutory compliance 
program covering 80 countries and 14 regulatory 
areas across major business enabling functions 
in 2018. The program instituted a self-assessment 

of the compliance status against a compliance 
framework with a maker checker process built into 
it alongside enabling the creation of a repository of 
compliance proofs against selfassessment. Through 
aggregating compliance proofs across countries 
and regulatory areas, Infosys designed an OCRbased technology to scan the proofs and validate if 
the proofs corroborate the compliance status. The 
technology was further leveraged to combine it with 
a rule engine testing compliance control around 
timeliness and accuracy of the compliance proof 
uploaded. 

Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption (ABAC) 
program 
Infosys develops and manages multiple office 
facilities and collaborates with multiple vendors/
service providers during various phases of 
construction. Infosys engages with vendors for 
infrastructure development, facility maintenance 
and physical security. Sometimes, services to be 
obtained include permits, licenses, approvals, 
marketing activities / expenses, awareness 
campaigns and liaising with the authorities for 
filings and reporting requirements.

Infosys has implemented controls in procure-topay process to ensure appropriate proof of service 
by vendors is submitted, reviewed, and approved 
before payments are released. The systems also 
monitor the process of requisitioning, purchasing, 
receiving, paying, and accounting for goods 
and services, from the point of order through to 
payment. Some of the controls built into the process 
are: 
• Traceability of transactions at initial procurement 

stages through user declaration and OCR 
technology. 

• Trail of documentation to substantiate various 

milestones and proofs of services availed. 

• Built-in escalation matrix to ensure timely approval 
of red flags identified for appropriate resolution 
and action. 

• Tracking of potential red flag indicators through 

use of tools. 

• Periodic assessments of transactions on sample 

basis considering factors such as high-risk 
vendors/transactions.

In addition, digitized self-assessment and 
certification is also rolled out as part of monitoring 
and controls.

Grievance redressal 
Our grievance redressal mechanisms are articulated 
in the Infosys Code of Conduct and Ethics including 
a Whistleblower mechanism with non-retaliatory 
clauses for all stakeholders. Additionally, employees 
and contractual staff have access to robust 
resolution hubs. Suppliers are advised of grievance 
redressal mechanisms through the Supplier 
Code of Conduct which they mandatorily sign. 
Employees, as important stakeholders, provide their 
feedback on a variety of topics on engagement 
through the periodic pulse survey. This offers 
them an opportunity to share feedback on the 
design, review and improvements to grievance 
mechanisms. Infosys is committed to providing a 
safe and positive work environment. Employees 
also have access to forums where they can highlight 
matters or concerns faced at the workplace. This is 
achieved through grievance resolution mechanism

Infosys is an active member of the WEF’s Alliance of 
CEO Climate Leaders, a coalition of business leaders 
dedicated to accelerating the transition to a net-zero 
economy. This involves setting science-based targets, 
transparently disclosing emissions, and fostering 
decarbonization and collaborative partnerships 
throughout global value chains. Recognizing the 
necessity of publicprivate collaboration to limit 
global warming to 1.5 °C, Infosys, as part of this 
alliance, signed an open letter to global leaders at 
COP29 reinforcing this commitment.

Infosys actively contributes to global thought 
leadership through the participation of its key 
executives in strategic panel discussions. Inderpreet 
Sawhney, Chief Legal and Compliance Officer, 
engaged in multiple high-level dialogues hosted by 
The Female Quotient, addressing critical topics such 
as ‘Reimagining Workplaces that Work for Everyone’

Davos
Demonstrating its deep-rooted commitment 
to sustainability, Infosys ensured a completely 
carbon-neutral presence at Davos 2025. 
This was achieved through the adoption of 
sustainable methods and materials to minimize 
emissions. For any unavoidable emissions, 
Infosys invested in certified Gold Standard 
carbon offsets, underscoring its proactive 
approach to environmental responsibility.

At Davos, Infosys and Street Child jointly hosted 
a significant panel discussion addressing the 
critical issue of ‘Education in Emergencies: 
When the Cameras Leave’. With the unrest 
in Ukraine nearing its third year, Infosys 
strategically highlighted the often-overlooked 
education crisis that persists in such contexts. 
Recognizing that Education in Emergencies 
is a global and enduring challenge, the panel 
underscored the situation in Ukraine, where 
over 3,000 schools have been damaged or 
destroyed, leaving approximately 1.9 million 
school-aged children reliant on partial or fully 
remote learning. In response to this urgent 
need, Infosys has partnered with Street Child, 
actively contributing through initiatives such as 
the renovation of seven digital learning centers 
in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and the development 
of vital teacher and student resources via the 
Infosys Springboard platform.

Thought Leadership in Data Privacy

We understand that staying ahead in a dynamic privacy landscape requires leadership and advocacy beyond the organization. The 
Infosys Data Privacy Office is deeply engaged with global industry bodies, regulatory groups, and standard-setting organizations. 
Through these partnerships, we help shape the development of data protection frameworks, policies, and international 
standards, particularly in emerging areas such as artificial intelligence. Senior leaders from the DPO frequently represent Infosys at 
international conferences and collaborate with governments and institutions to inform regulatory direction. These contributions 
underscore our role not just as a compliant entity, but as a driver of best practices in data privacy across industries and borders.

to receive Binding Corporate 
Rules (BCR) approval from EU data

Evolving notion of privacy
At Infosys, we recognize that the rapidly evolving 
digital landscape has reshaped the very meaning 
of privacy. With the proliferation of technologies 
such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, 
and big data, we are seeing transformative benefits 
across society. However, these same technologies 
introduce greater risks related to data privacy 
and security. Our business model involves the 
seamless global flow of data, which must comply 
with regulations that often have extraterritorial 
reach. That’s why we emphasize the importance 
of consistent and effective data protection 

69 | External Document © 2025 Infosys Limited 

practices across every country we operate in. Our 
independent Data Privacy Office (DPO) is central 
to this effort, ensuring that privacy is balanced 
with innovation. As AI continues to evolve, we are 
mindful that many existing privacy regulations 
already apply to AI systems that process personal 
data, and we closely align our practices with 
key principles like transparency, fairness, nondiscrimination, explainability, and human oversight.

To effectively manage these evolving risks and 
regulatory expectations, we have built a strong 
internal governance structure that supports our 
privacy objectives across the organization.

Governance and Organizational Structure 
A well-defined governance model forms the 
backbone of our privacy framework. The Data 
Privacy Office at Infosys functions as both architect 
and checker of privacy controls, while businessenabling functions and delivery teams serve as 
makers. Periodic audits by internal and external 
entities reinforce accountability, and quarterly 
reviews by senior management provide strategic 
direction. Our multi-tiered governance is further 

enhanced by three dedicated councils: the Privacy 
Sub-Council, comprising representatives from 
delivery and enabling functions; the Data Privacy 
Council, which includes business unit and function 
heads; and the Legal Compliance and Risk Council, 
featuring senior leadership such as the General 
Counsel, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Risk 
Officer.

This governance model supports our broader 
compliance strategy, which is focused on aligning 
operational practices with regulatory mandates 
and internal standards. Sustained Approach to Data 
Privacy Compliance.

Sustained Approach to Data Privacy 
Compliance

Infosys has long recognized the importance 
of a strategic and structured approach to 
privacy compliance. More than a decade ago, 
we established our Data Privacy function as 
an independent group reporting directly to 
top management. This function is built on 
the globally recognized Privacy Information 
Management System (PIMS) framework and is 
responsible for ensuring compliance with data 
protection regulations across business processes, 

applications, and client engagements. Our Data 
Privacy Policy—accessible to all employees via the 
intranet—reflects top management’s commitment 
to privacy. This commitment extends beyond 
internal operations to include third-party service 
providers. In line with our values of transparency 
and accountability, we provide privacy notices at 
data collection points for both internal and external 
data subjects. The privacy statement for external 
stakeholders is also publicly available on our 
website and is routinely updated to reflect changes 
in data handling practices or applicable laws.

As we continue to build on this foundation, 
embedding privacy into the design of our systems 
and services has become a key enabler of both 
compliance and innovation.

Customer data sharing 
Customer data and cybersecurity is of the utmost 
importance to us. Infosys will provide information 
as sought by any Government or law enforcement 
agencies, in accordance with our legal obligations. 
We have not received any request for customer 
information from Government and law enforcement 
agencies in FY 2025.

Cross-Jurisdictional Compliance
At Infosys, we maintain a robust, enterprise-wide 
data privacy and compliance framework designed 
to meet the complex and evolving regulatory 
requirements across jurisdictions. A dedicated 
compliance team actively monitors legal and 
regulatory developments globally, leveraging 
inputs from multiple sources, including regulatory 
databases, industry bodies, law firm alerts, and 
consulting advisories. This monitoring enables near 
real-time identification of changes and facilitates 
timely compliance actions.

To operationalize compliance tracking, Infosys 
employs specialized tools while drawing on 
memberships with professional organizations 
including the International Association of Privacy 
Professionals (IAPP) and the Association of 
Corporate Counsel (ACC). A centralized compliance 
repository maps regulatory requirements to 
business-enabling functions, ensuring consistent 
implementation across the enterprise.

We conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments 
(DPIAs) prior to initiating new data processing 
activities or deploying technologies involving 
personal data. This ensures that privacy-by-design 
principles are embedded from the outset. Our 
incident response protocols include predefined 
procedures for notification, assessment, 
mitigation, and documentation, supporting 

adherence to cross-border data breach notification 
obligations.

In jurisdictions with data transfer restrictions, 
Infosys adopts appropriate legal mechanisms such 
as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and Joint 
Controller Agreements to legitimize international 
data transfers. Wherever possible, we aim to 
minimize or avoid such transfers in alignment with 
local regulatory expectations.

Demonstrating our commitment to global 
data privacy standards, Infosys became the 
first India-headquartered Company to receive 
Binding Corporate Rules (BCR) approval from EU 
data protection authorities—an internationally 
recognized framework for safeguarding personal 
data transferred outside the EU.

As we continue to build on this foundation, 
embedding privacy into the design of our systems 
and services has become a key enabler of both 
compliance and innovation.

EPIC — Embedding Privacy by 
Design into Infosys Culture
Integrates privacy by design into every 
stage of the software development 
lifecycle—from architecture to 
deployment

Privacy by Design Enablement 
We believe that privacy should be integrated at 
the design stage of any process or application that 
handles personal data. To embed this principle 
into our organizational DNA, we launched the 
EPIC initiative—Embedding Privacy by Design 
into Infosys Culture. Rolled out by the Data Privacy 
Office in collaboration with quality and delivery 
teams, EPIC is a company-wide strategic program.
It incorporates privacy considerations into the 
architecture, development, and deployment phases 
of the software lifecycle. Through this initiative, our 
development teams are trained to apply the seven 
foundational principles of Privacy by Design using 
privacy design strategies, patterns, and privacyenhancing technologies (PETs). This not only 
supports regulatory compliance but also fosters a 
privacy-first mindset among our engineers.

Our ability to design and deliver privacy-conscious 
solutions is further bolstered by adherence to 
global benchmarks and certifications.

Privacy Performance Metrics
We are continuously strengthening our data privacy 
measurement framework under the oversight of 
our Data Protection Office (DPO). Various metrics 
are regularly analyzed, reviewed for trends, and 
presented to senior leadership during the crossfunctional Quarterly Data Privacy Council Meetings. 
Insights from these reviews guide continuous 
improvement initiatives across the organization.

Data Subject Rights and Breach 
Management
Safeguarding the rights of individuals is 
fundamental to our privacy strategy. As data 
subject rights become a core component of 
regulatory frameworks around the world, we 
have implemented processes that allow us to 
address such requests in a timely and compliant 
manner—even in complex enterprise settings 
where data resides in multiple formats and 
geographies. Managing these rights involves careful 
navigation of overlapping legal exceptions and 
system limitations, but we remain committed to 
honoring them. In parallel, we have established a 
comprehensive incident and breach management 
framework. At Infosys, we have robust procedures 
in place to detect, assess, contain, and resolve 
data privacy incidents. Our team of dedicated 
privacy professionals works closely with business 
units, legal, information security, communications, 
and external providers to ensure rapid and 
effective response. For high-impact cases, or 
those that require it by law, we notify the affected 
individuals and supervisory authorities, offering 
full disclosure and support. Such incidents are 
also reported to our senior leadership via the 
Incident Disclosure Committee. Our zero-tolerance 
approach is reinforced through strict consequence 
management and preventive action mechanisms, 
with key lessons integrated into organization-wide 
awareness campaigns.

To ensure these efforts are sustainable, we have 
prioritized building a strong culture of privacy 
awareness throughout the organization.

Responsible Use of Personal 
Data in Generative AI 
Infosys integrates data privacy safeguards 
into all Generative AI (GenAI) deployments 
involving personal data. In accordance 
with our data protection framework and 
applicable legal requirements, Privacy Impact 
Assessments (PIAs) are conducted for each 
deployment. We implement both technical 
and organizational controls to ensure 
responsible data usage and uphold individual 
privacy rights.

Our governance is further reinforced by 
global certifications including ISO 27701 
(Privacy Information Management System) 
and ISO 42001 (AI Management System), 
which provide structured approaches 
for compliance and accountability in the 
evolving AI and data landscape.

Building awareness and culture of privacy
We actively promote a culture of privacy awareness 
among our employees and stakeholders. Each year, 
we celebrate Data Privacy Day through interactive 
and engaging activities such as quizzes, crosswords, 
Pictionary games, and “chat with the DPO” sessions. 
Senior leaders also deliver messages that reinforce 
the importance of privacy across the organization. 
Monthly privacy tips—based on real-world scenarios 
and evolving threat landscapes—are shared 
widely to deepen organizational understanding. 
Participation in our privacy awareness program 
is mandatory. Every Infosys employee and 
subcontractor is required to complete a rolespecific privacy awareness quiz annually, ensuring 
that knowledge remains both current and 
contextualized.

This internal commitment is mirrored by our 
external engagement efforts, through which we 
shape the broader privacy ecosystem.

Privacy Symposium 2025
The Data Privacy Office hosted a flagship, 
in-person event in 2024. Conducted in 
collaboration with our knowledge partners—
ACC, DSCI, and IAPP—the symposium 
brought together global privacy leaders, 
chief privacy officers, academics, and industry 
practitioners to explore emerging themes 
such as data monetization, India’s DPDP 
Act, engineering for privacy, and creating a 
privacy-first culture.

Looking ahead: Future-ready data privacy
As digital ecosystems evolve, Infosys is proactively 
preparing for a new generation of privacy challenges 
driven by technologies such as Generative AI, 
quantum computing, and decentralized identity. 
Our forward-looking strategy is anchored in 
innovation, resilience, and global accountability. 
As privacy risks increase in complexity, from AIgenerated content to biometric surveillance, digital 
identity, and smart environments, Infosys remains 

resolute in treating privacy not just as a compliance 
necessity but as a core ethical and enterprise value.

Infosys has set a strategic goal to expand its 
ISO 27701 certification across all relevant global 
operations in a phased manner in order to achieve 
enterprise-wide coverage, reinforcing our position 
as a global leader in privacy governance and 
ensuring that our privacy practices remain resilient 
and future-ready.

Cybersecurity Management and Reporting
The cybersecurity practices at Infosys have evolved 
to look beyond compliance. The comprehensive 
cybersecurity metrics program has been 
contributing to the continuous improvement of 
the existing security practices and integration of 
cybersecurity within the business processes.

Information management, being an essential 
part of good IT governance, is a cornerstone at 
Infosys and has helped provide the organization 
with a robust foundation. Care is taken to ensure 
that standardized policies or guidelines apply to 
and are practical for the organization’s culture, 
business, and operational practices. Cybersecurity 
requires participation from all spheres of the 
organization. Senior management, information 
security practitioners, IT professionals, and users 
have a pivotal role to play in securing the assets of 
an organization. The success of cybersecurity can 
only be achieved by full cooperation at all levels 
of an organization, both inside and outside and 
this is what defines the level of commitment here 
at Infosys.

As a final level of defense, we undergo many 
internal audits as well as external attestations 
and audits in a year at an organization level (e.g. 
SSAE-18 SOC 1 & SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001). We also 
undergo client account audits to assess our security 
posture and compliance against our obligations on 
an ongoing basis.

There was no material cybersecurity incident 
reported in fiscal 2025.

Our industry contributions and thought 
leadership
In this era of rapid technology disruptions and 
digital transformations, Infosys enables the 
businesses to embrace innovations and adapt to 
new technologies. We focus on strengthening cyber 
resiliency through platform led convergence and 
consolidation of security capabilities and deliver 
AI-first service offerings.

We promote cybersecurity through various social 
media channels such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and 
YouTube; sharing our point of views, whitepapers, 
service offerings, articles written by our leaders, 
their interviews stating various perspectives, and 
podcasts through our corporate handles providing 
cybersecurity thought leadership. The topics 
include impact of evolving technologies such 
as GenAI on cybersecurity, cloud security, data 
privacy and protection, and compliance, etc. In 
addition to this, we work with analysts such as PAC 

Group and industry bodies such as Data Security 
Council of India (DSCI), Information Security Forum 
(ISF), etc. to create joint thought leadership that 
is relevant to the industry practitioners. In our 
efforts to strengthen cyber awareness across social 
communities, we also participate in cybersecurity 
awareness initiatives led by non-profit organizations 
such as NASSCOM. Further, we publish a technology 
centric report that provides insights into emerging 
technology trends and how they can be applied 
to businesses. It essentially acts as a guide for 
enterprises looking to navigate the evolving digital 
landscape and make informed technology decisions 
based on current trends. We also host various 
global chapters of Infosys regularly that aim to be 
a catalyst for innovation and transformation in the 
cybersecurity domain. The distinguished members 
of the council collaborate to discuss, strategize, and 
prepare roadmaps to address the current security 
challenges of member organizations and help 
decipher the evolving industry trends. We, therefore, 
through various channels, drive awareness of and 
appreciation for cybersecurity.

Vulnerability Management
The vulnerability management program at Infosys 
follows best-in-class industry practices coupled 
with top-notch processes that have been evolving 
over the years. Rich experience of deftly managing 
the end-to-end vulnerability life cycle of Infosys 
Network and the constant hunger to stay abreast 
of the latest tools, technologies and related market 
intelligence have acted as a catalyst in fortifying the 
overall vulnerability management program.

A robust enterprise vulnerability management 
program builds the foundation for healthy security 
hygiene of an organization. The following practices 
have been put in place at Infosys for,

1. Real time asset discovery followed by 

instantaneous identification of vulnerabilities, 
misconfigurations, and timely remediation
2. Automation of vulnerability management, 

configuration compliance, security assessments 
and review for assets, applications, network 
devices, data, and other entities in real time
3. Close coupling of detection and remediation 
processes; auto prioritization to reduce the 
turnaround time for closure of detected 
vulnerabilities

4. Continuous monitoring of all public facing 

Infosys sites and assets for immediate detection 
of vulnerabilities, ports, or services

5. Regular penetration testing assessments and 

production application testing for detection and 
remediation of vulnerabilities on a real time basis

The vulnerability remediation strategy of Infosys 
focuses on threat-based prioritization, vulnerability 
ageing analysis and continuous tracking for 
timely closure. We have successfully eliminated 
the ticketing system for vulnerability tracking 
by establishing a continuous detection and 
remediation cycle, where the IT teams are enabled 
and onboarded onto the vulnerability management 
platform. A Cybersecurity awareness culture is 
nurtured, and teams are encouraged to proactively 
remediate the vulnerabilities reported on their 
assets or applications.

Supply Chain Cyber Risk Management
A comprehensive supplier security risk management 
program at Infosys ensures effective management of 
potential security risks across the various stages of 
supplier engagement. The process comprises:
• Categorization of the suppliers based on the 

nature of the services provided and the sensitivity 
of the data involved.

• Defining standardized set of information security 
controls as applicable to each category of supplier

• Defining, maintaining, and amending relevant 
security clauses in the supplier contracts as 
applicable to each category of supplier
• Due diligence, security risk assessment for 

effective management of the information security 
risks associated with suppliers

Defining and monitoring of key security metrics 
for suppliers (e.g., background check, security 
awareness training completion, timely interventions 
with regard to information security incidents 
etc.) threat intel tracking and governance further 
strengthen the Infosys supplier security risk 
management program.

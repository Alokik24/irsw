ABOUT THIS REPORT

This 2023 Environmental Social Governance Report (“Report”) is the fifth Environmental Social Governance (ESG) report issued by The 
Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz” or the “Company”). This Report reflects our commitment to transparency and provides details on our 
ESG progress in the calendar year ending December 31, 2022. Topics included in this report are based on our most significant ESG issues 
which are reviewed and updated based on our ESG Materiality Assessment. 

This Report does not include details on our financial performance. Details on our financial performance can be found in our public filings 
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and on our investor relations website at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com. Materiality 
as used in this report, sometimes referenced as “ESG materiality,” and our ESG materiality review process are intended to reflect priority 
ESG issues and do not have the same meaning as materiality under U.S. securities laws, in our filings with the SEC, or under similar laws 
in other jurisdictions. Issues deemed material for purposes of this Report and for purposes of determining our ESG strategies may not be 
considered material for other purposes, including our SEC or other reporting. 

Unless otherwise noted, Kraft Heinz generally utilizes an operational control approach, and this Report covers initiatives and performance 
metrics associated with our global operations. Kraft Heinz anticipates issuing an ESG Report annually.

We have utilized the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a guiding framework in the development of our ESG 
initiatives. This Report also serves as our Communication on Progress as a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact and 
 CEO Water Mandate. 

Kraft Heinz supports the SDGs, which represent a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for 
all. As such, we considered the SDGs when developing Kraft Heinz’s global ESG strategy and goals. The global ESG strategy of Kraft Heinz 
supports all 17 SDGs in varying degrees. 

This Report was prepared utilizing the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Standard. We have also aligned this Report to the 
general principles of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) for food and beverage companies, as well as the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD). Separate downloads of our ‘GRI,’ ‘SASB,’ and ‘TCFD’ disclosures are available on our website 
at www.KraftHeinzCompany.com/ESG.

Kraft Heinz engaged with Bureau Veritas and SGS United Kingdom Ltd. to provide limited assurance in relation to specific 2022 
environmental data. Details on our assurance activities are available in the appendix of this Report and on our website at  
www.KraftHeinzCompany.com/ESG.

We welcome feedback on our ESG strategy and goals. To share questions or comments, please contact ESG@kraftheinz.com.

A LETTER FROM THE CEO

What a delicious difference a year makes! 

In our 2022 ESG Report, we showed how we collaborate with our stakeholders to help 
feed the world through the products our employees bring to consumers — all coming 
Together at the Table.

This year, we’re setting our table for the future and taking these fruitful partnerships to 
the next level. Environmental Social Governance (ESG) practices are integrated into our 
long-term business strategy, from sustainably sourcing our ingredients to ensuring we’re 
prioritizing a more diverse and inclusive workforce and supplier base. 

We’re proud to share the meaningful progress we made in 2022, as we continue 
centering our ESG goals around three pillars: Healthy Living & Community Support, 
Environmental Stewardship, and Responsible Sourcing. Our Company Value,  
We dare to do better every day, focuses us on priorities and issues where we can make  
the greatest impact.  

The only way we’ll achieve real long-term progress is by teaming up with Kraft Heinz 
colleagues and a broad, diverse range of stakeholders. At the heart of Together at the 
Table are two of my favorite words: culture and collaboration. 

We have built a culture of creativity and innovation at Kraft Heinz. Not only do we bring 
this to life by delivering quality products with delicious new flavors and tastes, but in our 
approach to tackling complex, challenging ESG goals. 

To reduce our environmental footprint, we’re leading with our products. We partnered 
with Pulpex to develop a paper-based, renewable and recyclable Heinz tomato ketchup 
bottle made from 100 percent sustainably sourced wood pulp – the first sauce brand to 
test its potential. We removed the legendary plastic “shaker” bag from our Shake ‘N Bake 
portfolio, eliminating approximately 900,000 pounds of plastic waste annually. And we 
teamed up with our UK retail customer Tesco to turn soft plastics returned by shoppers 
into recyclable Heinz Beanz Snap Pots, saving approximately 22 tons of plastic  
from landfills. 

Responding to changing consumer tastes and wants, we 
reduced sugar in Capri Sun beverages an average of 40% while 
keeping the iconic, delicious taste kids love. Through our game-
changing U.S. joint venture with tech startup NotCo, we’re 
teaming our iconic brand portfolio and scale with NotCo’s  
AI-driven innovation — to offer co-branded plant-based  
Kraft NotCheese. 

For us, everything starts at the source – either in the ground or 
from supplier partners. We’re making real progress on our goal 
to purchase 100 percent sustainably sourced tomatoes for our 
Heinz tomato ketchup by 2025. To source 100 percent of eggs 
we use globally from cage-free or better hens by 2025.   

I won’t sugar coat the pill: doing work this important is hard. We’ve brought together some of 
the most creative and innovative minds from across Kraft Heinz and outside to help solve these 
challenges. And because our Value We do the right thing is part of our people’s DNA, we do it with 
honesty and integrity. 

We are working hard each day to make life delicious. So pull up a chair, grab a plate – and join  
us on our continuing journey to help create a more sustainable world. We owe the future  
nothing less.  

Miguel Patricio 
Chief Executive Officer and Chair of the Board of Directors 
The Kraft Heinz Company

FOCUSING ON MATERIAL ESG ISSUES

ESG Materiality* and Stakeholder Engagement
To inform and continuously improve upon our ESG strategy, we engage a wide variety of stakeholders for input. Participating in an ongoing, two-way dialogue with our stakeholders 
strengthens our understanding of important environmental, social and governance issues, which helps us set associated priorities to make respective impacts.

Our global stakeholder network includes both the internal and external people and parties whose support is important to the long-term success of our business, and those who are 
materially impacted by our business operations. The table below lists these groups and summarizes our engagement activities with them.

* Materiality and its relevant definition as used in this report, sometimes referenced as “ESG materiality,” and our ESG materiality review 
process, is different than the definition used in the context of filings with the SEC. Issues deemed material for purposes of this Report and 
for purposes of determining our ESG strategies may not be considered material for SEC reporting purposes.

ESG Materiality Assessment 

To inform our ESG strategy and goal-setting, Kraft Heinz conducts a comprehensive ESG materiality assessment every three to five years, 
with respective smaller interim updates as appropriate. This assessment allows us to identify and prioritize the environmental, social, 
and governance issues that are of greatest concern to our stakeholders and relevant to the success of our business. We reevaluate these 
results on an ongoing basis to reflect any substantial changes in standing on these priority issues and allow for the inclusion of new or 
emerging issues. We treat our ESG materiality matrix as a living assessment based on participant input. We continue to evaluate material 
ESG issues to our key stakeholders and the respective impact on our business operations across dynamic global markets. Material issues 
are monitored regularly by a variety of internal stakeholders including Kraft Heinz leadership, ESG and the Corporate and Government 
Affairs ESG Subcommittee. In 2022, we updated our ESG materiality assessment using Datamaran’s cloud-based AI software platform. 
Datamaran’s patented technology provides our ESG Steering Committee with real-time data analysis to identify and monitor new or 
emerging issues that may impact Kraft Heinz, including regular insight into our Company’s unique strategic, regulatory, and reputational 
risks and opportunities. The assessment includes signals from across a variety of different sources, including corporate annual filings, 
mandatory regulations, voluntary policy initiatives, online news and media, as well as a cross-functional employee survey. Through 
this tech-enabled, dynamic, and data-driven approach, we have strengthened our strategy and governance process to meet the rise of 
stakeholder demands at Kraft Heinz.

Enterprise Risk Management 

Kraft Heinz has an established, comprehensive approach to Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). Annually, senior management evaluates 
changes and required updates to the top enterprise risks. The ERM process covers a broad spectrum of risks across several dimensions: 
ESG, strategic, financial, operational, legal and regulatory, human capital, and hazard/catastrophic. Senior management prioritizes the 
risks and develops the Kraft Heinz risk profile, which is shared with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors annually. Each risk 
owner provides regular updates to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

compulsory trainings on issues such as anti-corruption, conflict of interest, dignity and 
respect, whistleblowing, IT security, and due diligence matters. All training is monitored 
and tracked by the Ethics and Compliance (E&C) team. To reinforce our commitment to 
our Value, We do the right thing, we designate critical E&C courses as Threshold Training 
and set their completion rate as an E&C bonus qualifier for each zone. This means that 
each zone — North America, International, and Corporate — must achieve at least 90 
percent completion of all threshold training courses by the end of the year to reach 
their full bonus potential. If a zone does not meet or exceed their threshold training 
completion target, the total amount of bonus available for that Zone reduces by  
10 percent.

To help employees report potential misconduct, the Company provides several reporting 
methods, including through managers, Human Resources, Legal and the Ethics & 
Compliance team. In addition, we have a confidential Ethics & Compliance Helpline 
for reporting an ethics or compliance concern. The Helpline has multilingual staff 
available 24 hours a day. It is accessible globally by a toll-free phone call or online at 
KraftHeinzEthics.com. We do not tolerate retaliation against an employee who reports 
potential misconduct in good faith.

Supplier Guiding Principles 

Kraft Heinz has developed a set of Global Principles applicable to its supply chain 
partners referred to as the Supplier Guiding Principles. In 2021, Kraft Heinz launched our 
updated Supplier Guiding Principles in accordance with our commitment for improved 
efficacy and due diligence with our valued suppliers around sustainable business 
practices. The Supplier Guiding Principles apply to all suppliers (including external 
manufacturers), and we have plans to include joint venture partners in the near future. 
Read more about our Supplier Guiding Principles on page 59.

Political Contributions and Lobbying Activity 

As part of the Company’s ongoing engagement in the communities where our employees 
live and work, we engage in the political process to help shape public policies that 
impact our business around the world. Our goal is to ensure issues that impact our 
value chain, including employees, suppliers, customers, consumers, and shareholders 
are fairly represented at all levels of government. For more information on our political 
contributions and lobbying activity, please visit https://www.kraftheinzcompany. com/
contributions.html. Kraft Heinz engages responsibly in the political process in the 
communities where our employees live and work. Our goal is to ensure public officials 
representing our people, products and manufacturing facilities understand the issues 
that impact our business. We adhere to the local laws and regulations governing 
interactions with government officials, and participate in the political process through 
issue advocacy and political contributions. In North America, Kraft Heinz has put 
in place effective compliance procedures for, and oversight of, lobbying activities, 
corporate contributions and The Kraft Heinz Political Action Committee (Kraft Heinz 
PAC) expenditures. The Kraft Heinz Code of Conduct requires all employees to maintain 
honest, forthright, and transparent relationships with government officials.

Public Disclosure 

Kraft Heinz believes that an important aspect of engaging in the political process is transparency and disclosure. Kraft Heinz files 
information as required by federal and state campaign finance and disclosure laws. The Kraft Heinz PAC reports its contributions to the 
Federal Election Commission (FEC), the details of which are publicly available on the FEC website. All Kraft Heinz PAC and Company 
political contributions since 2012 are listed on our website. This includes contributions to ballot initiatives and 501(c) (4) organizations 
where funds may be utilized for political purposes. This information is updated semi-annually. In addition, Kraft Heinz partners with 
outside counsel to conduct an annual internal audit of all lobbying practices and reporting.

Lobbying Activity 

Kraft Heinz prepares and files reports with the Secretary of the U.S. Senate and the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives quarterly, 
which detail lobbying activities and expenditures. These reports are available here. The Company also files lobbying reports with many 
U.S. state and municipal governments as required by law. These reports are publicly available through the websites of the jurisdictions 
where they are filed.

Trade Association Membership 

Kraft Heinz believes that trade association membership and participation provides a number of benefits to our business and employees, 
including the ability to remain engaged on relevant issues and as a forum for sharing ideas and information. The Company’s involvement 
with trade associations does not include engaging in political activity. Kraft Heinz instructs trade associations that our dues must only be 
used on issues of importance to our business and none may be provided to support or oppose political candidates. You can find language 
sent to trade associations here.

ESG STRATEGY

In support of our Vision, To sustainably grow by delighting more consumers globally, we are committed to responsible, sustainable practices extending to each facet of our business. The Kraft Heinz ESG strategy  
prioritizes the issues that matter most to the Company business and stakeholders, focusing on areas that have the greatest impact. It includes three key pillars: Healthy Living & Community Support, Environmental 
Stewardship, and Responsible Sourcing. 

Our goal is to build value among our Company’s broad set of stakeholders by incorporating socially responsible business practices within our own operations and across every stage of our supply chain.  
We’re setting ambitious environmental goals, sourcing sustainably, improving the products we sell, and making impactful advancements in communities – all with a commitment to transparency and two-way dialogue.  
This continues to be our way forward.

HEALTHY LIVING  
& COMMUNITY SUPPORT

ENVIRONMENTAL  
STEWARDSHIP

RESPONSIBLE  
SOURCING

A key part of our corporate strategy is a commitment to people, to 
nutrition and health, and to making life delicious all at once. Some of 
the actions we are taking to support this commitment include ongoing 
improvements to the nutrition of our product portfolio, transparent 
and responsible marketing and communications, and alignment with 
credible science and public health goals.

Through these actions, we aim to contribute to the key priorities and 
target achievements outlined by the World Health Organization’s 
Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable 
Diseases, and the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals.

Environmental stewardship begins with our operational footprint, 
where we actively strive to conserve water and energy, reduce emissions, 
minimize waste, and make our packaging sustainable. 

At Kraft Heinz, we not only believe in striving to be better every day 
within our own operations, but we aspire to work with our entire value 
chain to continually improve on social and environmental factors. 

Our manufacturing sites can consume substantial amounts of resources, 
and are controlled by us, so we focus significant efforts around 
environmental stewardship inside of our walls.

We are dedicated to responsible sourcing and related impacts in critical 
areas to Kraft Heinz and our stakeholders. These include areas of focus 
such as human rights, deforestation, animal welfare and sustainable 
agriculture. We are also committed to strengthening our due diligence 
and management programs, while keeping the needs of our suppliers 
and our customers a top priority.

Corporate Highlights

At Kraft Heinz, we believe that everyone should have a seat at the table. We are committed to 
creating a diverse and inclusive workplace because we believe that it makes us stronger, more 
thoughtful, and more innovative. We are committed not only to listening to different points of 
view, but also to truly hearing them. By embracing diverse perspectives, we can make better

To ensure we continually improve, we collect data and feedback from a wide range of sources 
to inform our initiatives. This information helps us to identify areas where we can improve 
and develop data-driven plans to drive progress. As a result, we have established strategies 
to promote diverse hiring, retention, development, and advancement to support our global 
aspirations. By taking these steps, we create a workplace where everyone feels welcomed, 
valued, and respected.

We recognize the importance of learning and training opportunities to foster understanding 
and appreciation of diversity among our employees. As part of this commitment, we have 
introduced development initiatives such as interrupting bias in our Organizational People 
Review process to help managers identify and address unconscious bias in their assessments 
and ensure fair evaluations. Additionally, in our global program, The Heart of Kraft Heinz, 
we include a module which focuses on our Value of We demand diversity and emphasizes 
the significance of diversity and inclusion in the workplace and equips our employees with 
tools and resources to create a more inclusive environment. We believe these learning and 
training opportunities are integral to our commitment to build a more diverse, inclusive, and 
welcoming workplace.

We have made significant progress in our diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEI&B) 
journey. We have established a solid foundation of awareness across the organization, 
celebrated numerous impactful achievements, and educated and trained our leaders to be 
inclusive. We have created a nurturing community, spotlighted exemplary leaders from all 
backgrounds, and expanded a team of practitioners across our global footprint. We are proud 
of our progress, but we know that there is still more work to be done. We are committed to 
continuing our journey and creating a workplace where everyone can thrive.

(This is on our journey towards our 
ultimate aspiration of 56%, which is 
the national average. Pretos e Pardos 
translates to Black & two or more 
races respectively.)

In 2022, we focused on allyship, storytelling, and action to advance our work to create a 
more diverse and inclusive workplace. We continue to push ourselves to expand our impact 
across geographical regions while being thoughtful about the multiple definitions of diversity 
throughout the world. We also participated in the Women in the Workplace Study sponsored 
by LeanIn.Org and McKinsey & Company, which reviewed our talent pipeline data as well as 
policies and practices to help gauge our best practice opportunities. Furthermore, we are proud 
to be included in the Global Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, demonstrating our commitment 
to transparency and supporting gender equality throughout the organization. 

We firmly believe that cultivating a truly inclusive culture is critical to our success. We continue 
to work towards our stated aspirations and hold ourselves accountable for our progress. By year 
end, we achieved our 2022 objectives, increasing by two percentage points both our Global 
Women in Management Aspiration and our U.S. Race/Ethnicity Aspiration. Furthermore, we 
improved our global engagement score for all of our key inclusion drivers including “Opinions 
Count,” “Belonging,” and “Inclusive Leaders,” moving us closer to our 2025 goal of placing in the 
top quartile among our peers. We will build upon this success and strive for more aspirations for 
countries where we operate, utilizing similar data collection efforts. 

Additionally, we understand the importance of verifying our inclusion aspirations by collecting 
data from our employees through our regular engagement surveys. We will also verify our 
aspirations through external recognition surveys and indices. This approach will ensure our 
inclusion aspirations are aligned with the experiences of our employees. We are committed to 
creating a more inclusive workplace and believe this approach will help to achieve our goals.

1 This is on our journey toward our ultimate aspiration of 31%. National average of population who identify as ethnic minorities is 14% across the U.K. and 40% within London. The aspiration is based on a weighted 
average of the split between our populations in our London office and our U.K. factories.

CREATING AND EXECUTING A GLOBAL STRATEGY

In our second year, we made significant progress on our multi-year DEI&B strategy which focused on four key areas: Representation,  
Communication & Learning, Culture, and Communities to bring our We demand diversity value to life. 

Annual Day of Service

We celebrated our third annual Kraft Heinz Day of Service on June 20, 2022, to honor and 
commemorate Juneteenth as a time for reflection, education, and action that is now a part 
of our annual calendar for both our U.S. and Canada employees. Employees listened to a 
conversation with Marcus Samuelsson, Award-Winning Chef, Restaurateur, Author, and 
Co-Owner of Red Rooster, who shared his career journey and experience raising money for 
the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) through a Steps Challenge. The North America Sales 
team showed up in a big way across the country by giving back in honor of Juneteenth, which 
included the creation of a leadership video shared company-wide. Additionally, our Newberry 
plant hosted their 2nd Annual Juneteenth celebration with 30 employee and family volunteers 
engaging with the local community.

We also sponsored the second year of a lunch and learn to honor the National Day of Truth and 
Reconciliation in Canada. Additionally, our International Zone hosted multiple days of service 
to support local communities. 

Ownerversity Day 

We hosted our third annual Ownerversity Day, a 24-hour global learning event designed to 
bring our entire Kraft Heinz family together to make time for learning. Our 2022 theme was 
“The Power of WE: My Difference Makes a Difference” and we offered a variety of immersive and 
engaging sessions focused on diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging. These sessions: 

•  Helped employees enhance their understanding of the lived experiences of 

colleagues and celebrate what makes them unique. 

•  Introduced the concept of inclusive design thinking for employees to leverage in their 

routines and rituals to make them fair, equitable, and unbiased. 

•   Encouraged employees to be the change they wish to see in the world through their 
everyday choices and actions that, when done together, create a ripple effect of 
change.

Employee Development 

To help diversify our internal pipeline, we continue to invest in the development of our 
employees’ skills, knowledge, and abilities to help them perform their jobs more effectively 
and contribute to Kraft Heinz’s success. In 2022, we introduced two of McKinsey & 
Company’s award-winning leadership academies specifically designed for people of color: 
the Management Accelerator and Executive Leadership programs. These programs create 
psychologically safe spaces for leaders to unpack diversity, equity, and inclusion challenges and 
become more impactful in their careers. 

We also piloted NextUp Soar program to give Associate Director level and above employees a 
career boost by elevating their executive skills and leadership goals. Participants learned skills 
to prepare them for growth, strengthen their influence, and inspire action and engagement 
by hearing from thought leaders and industry experts on the frontlines of a changing world. 
In China, we hosted an inaugural Women’s Leadership Day to celebrate the achievements of 
women in leadership roles and encourage the next generation of female leaders. 

In its third year, the Women’s Empowerment Network accelerator program, which is designed 
to bring clarity to the skills needed to advance, graduated a cohort of 28 global participants. 
The program focuses beyond leadership skills to the whole person; it is designed to feed mind, 
body, and spirit. It helps participants understand they are not defined only by what they do, but 
also by who they are, and the potential they can unleash when they believe in themselves.

Community Support 

Fostering Inclusion 

Creating an environment in which all employees feel valued, respected, and heard is a 
fundamental component of our strategy and one which we achieve through educational 
opportunities. We hosted a number of events throughout 2022, including global celebrations 
for International Women’s Day, Global Pride, and International Day for Persons with Disabilities. 
Annually, our Business Resource Groups (BRGs) lead significant events for employees related 
to their respective cultural, identity, or heritage communities including Black History Month, 
Asian Heritage Month, Latin American/Hispanic Heritage Month, and more. We also introduced 
a Religious Holiday Communications Plan into the annual DEI&B Observance Calendar to 
acknowledge these important moments for employees. 

In the development of our new Canada headquarters, we aligned to our purpose, Let’s Make 
Life Delicious, and our Values — particularly around We Champion Great People and We Demand 
Diversity to bring these Values to life in spaces and places across the office. Our accessibility and 
wellness features of the office include a gender-neutral universal washroom, a wellness space 
for meditation or prayer, a parent room for nursing, feeding and childcare routines, braille-
enabled elevators, as well as color & intuitive wayfinding that supports neurodiversity, and aids 
in navigation throughout the space. We are excited about the office launch in 2023. 

In the International Zone, we partnered with an external organization to complete an audit 
of our UK Disability Recruitment approach to improve our efforts in this community in three 
stages: education and training, implementation, and communication. The audit findings will 
guide our strategy moving forward to ensure true inclusion of current and future employees. 

Since 2020, our Glenview R&D Community Champions have leveraged their expertise and 
capabilities in STEM, culinary, nutrition, and project management to improve their local 
community and provide employees with an opportunity to connect through a passion for 
service. In 2022, they hosted and participated in a number of service initiatives including 
partnerships with Lasagna Love and Humble Design to assist clients exiting homelessness, 
Chicago High School of Agricultural Sciences for STEM and Career education, Chicago American 
Chemical Society Chemistry Day to inspire future scientists, and Glenview Sunrise Rotary 
Annual Hero Hustle to raise funds for community grants.  

Recruiting 

Inclusive recruiting is a key focus for us. As We dare to do better every day, a diverse workforce 
can help lead to increased innovation, productivity, and profitability. As such, we continue to 
review our partnerships to provide a welcoming and inclusive workplace for all. In 2022, we 
added and enhanced partnerships with the following organizations as examples: 

DisabilityIN: The leading nonprofit resource for business disability inclusion worldwide.  
They aim to create an inclusive global economy where people with disabilities participate fully 
and meaningfully.

Sister Circle: Black Women in Tech: A solidarity group dedicated to supporting the work of 
Black Women in the technology industry from across the diaspora.

Chronically Capable: Works to remove the fear and stigma of living with chronic illness or 
disability from the hiring process. They create a tacit understanding between employers and 
jobseekers: Employers who are part of the network believe that people living with chronic 
illness or disability are capable of being productive employees — and jobseekers who use the 
platform can feel secure that participating employers care about their success.

Bright Network: Connects the next generation with the opportunities, insights and advice to 
succeed as the workforce of tomorrow.

National Student Pride: Celebrates LGBTQI+ identities through conversation, and by 
connecting students to employers who can support them throughout their working life.

10,000 Interns Foundation: Provides paid internships for Black students and graduates 
through the 10,000 Black Interns program, and paid internships for disabled students and 
graduates of all ethnicities through the 10,000 Able Interns program across a range of U.K. 
industries.

Business Resource Groups (BRGs) 

BRGs play an important role in our culture and helping us advance our diversity, inclusion, equity, and belonging efforts. These groups are 
employee led, and support culture, career, community, and business initiatives at Kraft Heinz. 

Our BRGs in the North America Zone include:  

Our BRGs in the International Zone include: 

•  Asian Pacific American (APA) BRG; 
•  Black BRG; 
•  Pride BRG; 
•  Sabor BRG (for Latino/a/x & Hispanic employees);  
•  Veterans BRG;
•  Women’s BRG.

•  Gender Equality Network (GEN); 
•  The 57 (general cultural awareness and employee connection); 
•  Proudz (supporting LGBTQ+ employees); 
•  Reconciliation Working Group – an Australian BRG dedicated to building 

and delivering a RAP (Reconciliation Action Plan), with the aim to strengthen 
relationships between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and non-
Indigenous Australians.

To create a more diverse and inclusive organization, our Value, We demand diversity, is our north star around the globe and we challenge ourselves 
to bring this value to life every day. One way we do this is by continuing to invest in our BRGs so that they can provide a safe space for employees 
and allies to raise awareness of issues facing various communities, advocate for change in company policies and practices, as well as celebrate the 
rich diversity of our employees. Throughout the year, the BRGs had many accomplishments including our Reconciliation Working Group being 
recognized as a member of the Reconciliation Action Plan Network in Australia, the North America BRGs donating nearly $200,000 to local charities 
supporting historically marginalized communities, sponsoring a Workplace Pride Conference in Tokyo, hosting a cooking event for youth with 
disabilities in Thailand, participating in community activities such as the Bud Billiken Parade and Chicago AIDS Walk in Chicago, and BRG leaders 
completing a BRG Leadership Journey pilot in our International Zone. 

As a leader in this space, we are looking forward to continuing to celebrate diversity, promote equity, and create spaces where employees  
feel comfortable being themselves.

EMPLOYEE HEALTH & WELLNESS

We are committed to supporting and inspiring a lifestyle of well-being for our employees in and out of the workplace. We aim to provide 
equitable benefits coverage through affordable core plans of healthcare, protection, and future savings complemented by local benefits 
to address market trends and cultural nuances and access to additional plans tailored to meet individual needs and promote diversity, 
equity, and inclusion.

LiveWell at Kraft Heinz amplifies our commitment to help employees achieve optimal 
well-being physically, emotionally, socially,  and financially. Throughout the year, we raise 
awareness of health and well-being topics through speaker series, global and local events and 
targeted initiatives on physical fitness, nutrition, mental health, family and community, and 
financial education. In 2022, we partnered with our Nutrition team to introduce The Nutrition 
Nugget. This feature encourages our employees to “Eat Well, Be Well and LiveWell.” Information 
shared from the Nutrition2Nourish curriculum’s aim is to continue building and strengthening 
nutrition knowledge during our transformation journey to ‘DELIGHT consumers with a 
BALANCED and TRUSTED portfolio by delivering nutritious options and supporting  
HEALTHFUL LIVING’.

Our global LiveWell hub and complementary local LiveWell sites provide employees easy 
access to external resources and internal programs available in their local country. In 2022, 
we expanded our education reach via our learning platform, Ownerversity. This additional 
touchpoint helps employees navigate the elements of Total Rewards, including compensation, 
benefits, and recognition designed to provide a spectrum of programs that support our diverse 
workforce and their families. 

Since 2021, we have been conducting employee 
total rewards and well-being surveys plus industry 
and peer benchmark studies to assess whether our 
offerings are market competitive and if they meet 
the needs of our employees and their families. 
Opportunity areas are then actioned based on 
the benchmark data and employee feedback. Our 
LiveWell expos were reignited post-pandemic to 
provide employees the opportunity to learn about 
their local benefit plans directly from vendors and 
members of the benefit teams to make the best 
choice during the annual enrollment periods. 

In 2022, we made further enhancements to parental 
benefits and expanded paid parental leave for primary and secondary caregivers, including 
adoptive parents, surrogate situations, and same sex couples (where legally allowed), and 
expanded support for pregnancy loss to additional countries. Where relevant, we provide 
employees with paid time off for breastfeeding and we have dedicated nursing rooms in  
some locations.

At Kraft Heinz, we operate with empathy and care by supporting our people with the resources 
and tools to help them live well. Our Mental Health framework is a key part of this commitment 
and aims to create an open culture on this topic. Our Mental Health First Aiders (MHFA) program 
includes over 225 cross-functional trained colleagues. In addition to ongoing training, the 
MHFAs are identified in email signatures, lapel pins, and listed on the LiveWell hubs. We also 
provide Employee Assistance Programs (EAP) in 31 countries for confidential life event services 
ranging from personal, family, and work-related services provided by specialists for our 
employees and their families when needed.

WORKING TO ALLEVIATE  
GLOBAL HUNGER

Provide 1.5 billion meals to people in need by 2025 from 2019.

PROGRESS

66%

The Kraft Heinz Company Foundation (Kraft Heinz Foundation) pursues its mission through strategic partnerships with organizations that have 
programs aligned with hunger relief, nutrition support, and self-sustaining food sources. 

Our work towards alleviating global hunger is deeply rooted in the collective determination of our Foundation partners, Kraft Heinz brands, and 
dedicated employees. Kraft Heinz employees from all corners of the world have passionately joined the Foundation’s work through annual volunteer 
efforts, underscoring the critical nature and immediacy of our work in helping to alleviate world hunger. 

We are currently focused on our goal of providing 1.5 billion meals to those in need by 2025. In 2022 alone, we provided approximately 334 million 
meals to people in need. From 2019 through 2022, we’re 66 percent of the way to our 2025 goal of providing 1.5 billion meals to those in need. 

We have aligned our current key partners towards this goal:

Kraft Heinz defines a ‘meal’ or ‘meal equivalency’ as a unit of food or nutritional value. Kraft Heinz utilizes the meal count as a general guide to estimate the impact and reach of our philanthropic work to improve food 
insecurity. Meal equivalencies are calculated in close partnership with our expert charity partners and are based on several factors including targeted group (e.g.  children, adults, etc), local needs and regulations in the 
areas where they serve. For in-kind donations, where no specific meal equivalency calculation is available, Kraft Heinz uses the standard USDA equivalency where 1 meal is equivalent to 1.2 pounds of food.

Kraft Heinz is continuously striving to improve our approach to calculating the impact of our philanthropic work. In 2022, we further improved our meal equivalency calculation methodology in close collaboration with a 
global partner, which we also applied retroactively from 2020 to ensure consistency. This resulted in a lower restatement of historical meals from 2020-2021. We are still proudly on track to achieving our goal of providing 
1.5 billon meals to people in need in advance of 2025. 

Kraft Heinz Employees’  
Global Meal Packathon Returns
After a two-year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Kraft Heinz employees came 
“Together at the Table” in 2022 to fight global hunger by packing meals for children and 
families in need through the annual Kraft Heinz Meal Packathon – our largest company-
wide volunteering effort. Organized in partnership with Rise Against Hunger, Kraft Heinz 
offices and factories around the world joined together to pack approximately 700,000 
meals for children and families in need and raise awareness about global hunger. During 
this employee-led event, Kraft Heinz employees packed Rise Against Hunger’s signature 
meals that contain a blend of rice, soy, dried vegetables, and a micronutrient sachet 
developed in collaboration with food science and nutrition experts from Kraft Heinz.

KRAFT HEINZ BRANDS TAKE ACTION  
TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES

Quero and Comida Invisível 
Partner to Reduce Food Waste and 
Hunger in Nerópolis, Brazil 

In 2022, our Quero brand in Brazil launched an 
initiative to combat hunger and accelerate the growth 
of local circular economies by partnering with social 
tech startup Comida Invisível to create the Nerópolis 
Without Food Waste program. To start the food 
recovery program, Kraft Heinz and Comida Invisível 
secured buy-in from Nerópolis local authorities, 
business members, food producers, and teachers 
and enrolled more than 300 food-insecure families. 
Through Nerópolis Without Food Waste, which is wholly funded by Kraft Heinz, families were 
connected to 14,000 pounds of produce that would have otherwise been wasted due to its 
appearance. Additional support was provided to program participants through community 
events and increased access to social services and nutritionists. As Kraft Heinz and Comida 
Invisível look to the next phase of the program, they are planning to significantly grow its 
impact by expanding to more Nerópolis families and food producers. 

Heinz continues partnership 
with The LEE Initiative to 
Help Preserve Black-Owned 
Restaurants’ Cultural Legacy

The Heinz Black Kitchen Initiative, a partnership 
with The LEE Initiative and Southern Restaurants 
for Racial Justice (SRRJ), began in 2021 with 
the ambition to celebrate, uplift, and preserve 
the legacy of Black food by breaking down the 
barriers that keep Black voices and cooking out of 
the American culinary pantheon through a grant 
program for Black food business entrepreneurs. 
To further celebrate these voices, we also launched the award-winning Black Kitchen Series 
podcast, which spotlights Black culinary innovators and the many ways Black individuals are 
moving the culinary space forward. In 2022, Heinz continued this vibrant partnership resulting 
in more than 65 restaurants across the U.S. receiving grants from the Black Kitchen Initiative 
and bringing the brand’s total grant contribution so far to $2 million, with plans to continue 
expanding this program in 2023. 

ABC Brands Meets Community  
Nutrition Needs in Indonesia

Driven by a commitment to the communities across Indonesia where employees live 
and work, Kraft Heinz Indonesia, led by our legendary ABC brand, strives to do the right 
thing in all aspects of its business. Kraft Heinz Indonesia collaborates with over 20 local 
community partners through various food donation programs, donating meal packages to 
those in need. A key focus of this community work includes efforts in Indonesia to combat 
hunger while supporting national programs to accelerate stunting prevention, one of the 
critical social issues in childhood malnutrition. 

Commitment to Zero Food Waste, Zero Hunger  
Through School Breakfast Programs 

In 2022, ABC partnered with FoodCycle Indonesia – an Indonesian foodbank – to carry 
out a 14-week program that prepared and distributed breakfast meals to underprivileged 
school students in Greater Jakarta, bringing joy and nourishment to these children and 
ensuring they started their day with hope and possibility. In 2022, ABC donated more 
than 850,000 ABC products and 110,000 beverages as part of the meal packages that 
were provided to almost 3,200 school children through this program.

RISE AGAINST HUNGER

The Kraft Heinz Foundation (and prior to that, the H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation) has been a partner of Rise Against Hunger 
since 2013. Originating from the desire to provide nutritious and efficient meals to those facing hunger across the world, our 
partnership with Rise Against Hunger now impacts a wide variety of issues ranging from addressing global hunger through 
localized, urgent needs, to wider systemic, long-term projects. Today, we are Rise Against Hunger’s largest partner.

In July 2021, the Kraft Heinz Foundation committed to a $12 million donation, dispersed over 
the following three years to support Rise Against Hunger’s global efforts to end world hunger 
and put last-mile communities on a path to self-reliance. In 2022, during the second year of 
this commitment, Rise Against Hunger was able to reach over 4.4 million people through food 
distribution, local procurement, and sustainable agriculture projects.

In 2022, participants in Rise Against Hunger’s sustainable agriculture projects, supported 
by Kraft Heinz, in India, Malawi, Mali, Philippines, Senegal, South Africa, South Sudan and 
Zimbabwe, produced 5,538 metric tons of food and impacted more than 1 million people. 
These projects, which Rise Against Hunger implements with local partners, support long-
term food security through a variety of initiatives, including sustainable agricultural training, 
microenterprise loan programs to support small business, installations of water wells, solar 
pumps, and more. 

Planting Seeds for Strong Communities

 In addition to providing immediate nourishment to 
people facing hunger today, Rise Against Hunger promotes 
improvements in agricultural production and rural livelihoods 
to help individuals increase their incomes and access to food to 
achieve long-term food security.

Jacquelyne, a wife and mother, lives in Gokwe North, Zimbabwe. 
The community where she lives is prone to droughts and wildlife 
disruptions, which creates challenges for her family to harvest 
healthy crops. The Planting Seeds for Strong Communities 
project, implemented by Rise Against Hunger and impact partner ADRA International, 
establishes home-grown school feeding programs and trains farmers in climate-smart 
agriculture to support long-term food security in Zimbabwe. After participating in the project 
and receiving Village Savings and Loan Association group training, Jacquelyne now earns an 
income, which she uses to pay for her education and children’s school fees. She also provides 
meals at home for her family, alongside her husband, Blyberg, with the help of the community 
sheller and oil-pressing machine.  

“The introduction of the [program] liberated and empowered me. I now know that I must 
be an entrepreneur in order to make money. I was able to buy some goats and pay for 
my education. I was also able to pay for my children’s academic fees.”

FEEDING AMERICA

Feeding America® is a nationwide network of 200 food banks and 60,000 partner agencies that serve every county 
in America. In Feeding America’s words, “to end hunger, we have to make hunger unacceptable,” and that is why the 
organization encourages everyone to take action in the fight to end hunger in America, where 34 million people—1 in 10 
people — face food insecurity.

Our relationship with Feeding America dates back to Kraft Foods Group. Inc., as one of the 
original groups to provide the organization with financial support in the 1980s. 

Fresh Produce Sourcing Grants  

Today, Kraft Heinz helps Feeding America achieve its mission in a three-pronged approach. 
First, we help partner food banks meet immediate hunger needs through food donations 
from our corporate operations. In 2022, we donated more than 18 million pounds of food 
to the Feeding America network through 33 local partner food banks aligned with our U.S. 
manufacturing sites, bringing our total since 2019 to more than 78 million pounds of food 
donated. Second, through The Kraft Heinz Foundation’s philanthropic giving, we are able to 
significantly amplify food donations to families in need on a planned basis. Third, we further 
partner with Feeding America through cause marketing and volunteerism, all aimed at our 
shared mission to end hunger. 

“The movement to end hunger in America takes committed partnerships. By donating 
food, funding, and volunteer engagement, Kraft Heinz’s deeply rooted partnership with 
Feeding America helps us provide more meals to more people experiencing hunger. We 
are beyond grateful for the generous support.”

– Casey Marsh, Chief Development Officer, Feeding America

Kraft Heinz recognizes that healthy and nutritious food is 
essential in the journey toward food security. As part of our 
partnership with Feeding America, we support produce 
procurement programs. While the need for food exists 
in all pockets of the country, farmers and producers are 
concentrated in a handful of states, which creates inequity in 
food banks’ ability to purchase and source certain items. In 
2022, a grant from Kraft Heinz Foundation enabled Feeding 
America’s member food banks to overcome these logistical 
barriers and purchase millions of pounds of fresh produce for communities across  
the United States.  

Fight Hunger. Spark Change.   

Kraft Heinz participates in Walmart and Sam’s Clubs’ annual 
Fight Hunger. Spark Change. campaign.  During this cause-
marketing campaign, customers are invited to fight hunger in 
their communities through direct donations at the cash register 
or by purchasing qualifying items in all U.S. stores, clubs, or 
online. Suppliers donate the monetary equivalent of at least 
one meal ($0.10) to a Feeding America member food bank with 
each purchase of a qualifying item at Walmart and five meals 
($0.50) with each purchase of a qualifying item at Sam’s Club. 
In 2022, Kraft Heinz provided the equivalent of 5,592,910 meals through participation  
in this campaign.

SUPPORTING COMMUNITIES IN NEED 

Heifer International 

“Over the last several years, it has been a privilege to 
partner with Kraft Heinz to work together to end hunger 
and provide self-sustaining food sources. Kraft Heinz has 
a progressive approach to help create sustainable food sources that perfectly aligns 
with Heifer International’s mission to end hunger and poverty while caring for the Earth. 
Together, we have produced 166,000,000 meals within our Heifer Projects, and even more 
inspiring is their commitment to create a sustainable solution to end the hunger crisis in 
our world. We are fortunate to have such a strong partner working with us to transform 
the lives of our farmers and their communities, and the collaboration and innovation 
between our organizations gives me great hope for the future.” 

– Surita Sandosham, President and CEO, Heifer International

Share Our Strength: No Kid Hungry Campaign 

“We are so proud to continue our partnership with the 
Kraft Heinz Foundation. They deeply understand the issue 
of childhood hunger and the urgency with which it must 
be addressed. Their support is crucial to ensuring we are 
able to help programs reach as many kids as possible. We 
are so grateful for their continued commitment to No Kid Hungry and giving back to 
communities around the country.” 

– Jill Davis, Chief Resource Development & Growth Officer, No Kid Hungry 

Your donations help support programs that feed kids; No Kid Hungry does not provide 
individual meals. Learn more at NoKidHungry.org/OneDollar.

Red Cross 

Disaster
Responder Program

The Red Cross responds to more than 
60,000 disasters across the United States 
every year — mobilizing a team every 
eight minutes — providing relief, comfort, and hope to people during what 
can be the worst days of their lives. As large disasters like wildfires, tornadoes 
and hurricanes increase in frequency and intensity, donations from Disaster 
Responder members, like Kraft Heinz Foundation, continue to fuel Red Cross 
readiness and build response capacity in times of crisis.

Disaster Responder Program members pledge financial support in advance of 
disasters to power the Red Cross with strong infrastructure, trained volunteers, 
innovative technology, and critical resources necessary to provide relief and 
support when needed. These donations enable the Red Cross to respond to 
disasters at a moment’s notice — offering a safe place to sleep, a hot meal, 
emotional support, and resources to aid in recovery — while also helping 
prepare people and communities for future disasters.

“Every day, people across the country and around the world turn to the Red Cross 
for help in the face of emergencies. This has never been more true as disasters 
continue to increase in frequency and intensity on a global scale due to the 
climate crisis. We are deeply grateful for the generous and forward-thinking 
Disaster Responder Program members like the Kraft Heinz Company Foundation, 
which power us with the critical resources necessary to prepare for and respond 
to the continuous needs created by climate disasters.”

Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank

Food Banks Canada – What’s for Dinner? 

“The Kraft Heinz Foundation is a steadfast partner of Greater 
Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. We share a commitment that 
children and families should have access to the nutritious food they 
need to thrive. With support from the Foundation, the Food Bank recently opened its on-site 
food pantry called The Market. The Market provides supplemental groceries and non-food 
items to families at no cost. It also assists with referrals to other services like childcare, 
transportation, and employment assistance. We are thankful to have the support of Kraft 
Heinz to provide this critical service and for their partnership in other programming that 
provides meals to children both inside and outside of schools.”

– Lisa Scales, President and CEO, Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank 

Building on successful Kraft Heinz Pantry Day campaigns over the past 
two years, Kraft Heinz Canada rebranded its annual benefit campaign 
for Food Banks Canada in 2022 to ask, “What’s For Dinner?” During the 
four-week campaign, Canadians joined the fight against food insecurity 
by purchasing participating Kraft Heinz products in-store or online. For each participating 
product purchased, Kraft Heinz matched a meal donation to Food Banks Canada. Participating 
products included select products across Kraft, Philadelphia, Classico, Maxwell House, Nabob 
and Kraft Café Barista Coffee and Heinz brands. The initiative, which is part of a larger five-year, 
partnership with Food Banks Canada, is helping connect the millions of Canadians affected by 
food insecurity with the meals they need. 

Greater Chicago Food Depository

“Our longtime Chicago neighbors, The Kraft Heinz Company, remain 
a Strategic Partner of the Greater Chicago Food Depository and our 
work to end hunger in collaboration with 800 community partner 
sites across Cook County. Since 2016, Kraft Heinz has provided the 
equivalent of more than 5 million meals to our neighbors facing food 
insecurity, including children and older adults – 600,000 meals in the last year alone. We are 
so grateful to Kraft Heinz for helping us to create a truly Greater Chicago.” 

– Kate Maehr, Executive Director and CEO, Greater Chicago Food Depository

The Lunchbox Fund

“Since January 2022, Kraft Heinz’s support has enabled 
Lunchbox Fund to serve over 2 million meals to 9,950 school 
children across Southern Africa. Less than 50 percent of the 
poorest children ever complete school. Many of them, especially girls, are sent out to work, 
or made to stay home to look after the elderly or younger siblings. A guaranteed meal, 
served at school, incentivizes parents to keep their children in school, allowing them to 
graduate. When children know a delicious meal awaits them at school — they arrive on 
time, attend regularly and are able to focus and learn while they were in class. The impact 
of these meals cannot be understated. A single educated child, once employed, can take 
her whole family out of poverty in a single generation. Kraft Heinz’s school meals are life-
changing to the world’s poorest children. They are a gate to the future.”

– Topaz Page-Green, Founder, Lunchbox Fund

Magic Breakfast 

2022 marked the fourth year of our partnership with Magic Breakfast, a 
charity that provides healthy school breakfasts to hungry and malnourished 
children in disadvantaged areas of the U.K. What began as a partnership 
around a shared goal of helping ensure no child is too hungry to learn in the 
U.K. has since evolved into a deep collaboration between Magic Breakfast and Heinz that looks 
beyond food support and financial donations to drive long-lasting change to improve child 
morning hunger. This includes engagement initiatives such as mentoring sessions and work 
experience weeks for students. We have also helped lobby members of parliament in support 
of Magic Breakfast’s goal of leaving no child hungry in the U.K. In 2022, Kraft Heinz donated 
approximately 2 million meals to kids at risk of hunger in the U.K. and maintained delivery of No 
Added Sugar Heinz Beanz to an increased roster of 300 Magic Breakfast partner schools across 
England and Scotland.

Global Nutrition Guidelines 

The Kraft Heinz Global Nutrition Guidelines are category-specific and set maximum levels 
for main nutrients of public health concern: total sugars, sodium, saturated fat, and calories. 
The nutrition targets consider the dietary role of the product as outlined in dietary guidelines 
(USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025, Australian Dietary Guidelines 2013, Sante 
Public France, 2019) and take into account product characteristics as well as technological and 
safety constraints.  They are the foundation we use to develop new products and improve the 
nutritional value of our current portfolio. We remain committed to increasing positive nutrients 
and plant-based offerings.  

Progress on Healthy Living Goals 

Compliance* with Kraft Heinz’s nutrition targets increased from 67.7 percent in 2021 to 71.8 
percent in 2022. We are pleased with our progress on this goal and have developed roadmaps 
that are embedded into our business strategy. Further, we have internal incentives in place 
to drive progress and have strong governance mechanisms (See page 9 on our internal 
governance structure) in place to ensure we reach our goal of 85 percent compliance by 2025. 
This increase was driven by the evolution of our global portfolio towards healthier options and 
the introduction of nutritious new products. 

In 2022, we continued our efforts to improve the quality of data and transparency within 
regions that had not previously been measured. Expanded assessed regions included Poland, 
Turkey, Egypt and several countries in Latin America. Our data is now representative of 
approximately 92 percent of our overall scope for this goal. 

Further to our nutrition targets, we successfully reduced approximately 47 million pounds of 
total sugar across our portfolio in 2022 and are now 95 percent toward our goal of reducing 60 
million pounds of total sugar across our global portfolio by 2025. This reduction was primarily 
driven by our Capri Sun (see page 35) and Kool Aid Jammers sugar reduction strategy but we 
also continue to make significant sugar reductions globally such as across our ABC brand in 
sauce and juice categories. For example, we reduced sugar by 10 percent in our SOTO sweet 
soy sauce, which led to a reduction of 270,000 pounds of sugar in 2022. We are still working 
hard toward implementing sugar reduction products throughout our portfolio and will be 
developing new goals in the next few years.  

 In 2022, we initiated development on BBQ Sauce and Kraft Salad Dressing recipes for our  
North America sodium reduction goal with plans to implement in 2024 and 2025. We are 
actively working on renovating our products and are confident that we will achieve our 5 
percent sodium reduction goal. Globally, we made some significant strides in sodium reduction 
such as in our Quero brand sauce and vegetables categories in Latin America (see page 35 for  
more details).

As we look to the future, we have roadmaps in place to improve the nutrition across our core 
brands such as Kraft, Heinz, Classico, and across key product categories including a major 
sodium reduction strategy across soy sauce offerings in China. As we continue on our global 
nutrition transformation, we will continue reducing sugar, sodium, saturated fat, and calories 
across our portfolio. Our nutrition priorities in the coming years are to continue reducing 
nutrients of public health concern and gradually increase positive nutrients (fiber, minerals and 
vitamins) while addressing consumer preferences related to taste and texture. 

* Inclusive of all countries with measurable data where Kraft Heinz operates. Kraft Heinz Foodservice, Kraft Heinz Ingredients and infant/toddler categories are not included in the overall metric. 
Kraft Heinz Foodservice and Kraft Heinz Ingredients items do not have specific nutrition targets and infant/toddler product targets are based on local guidelines.

INNOVATING OUR PORTFOLIO

At Kraft Heinz, we are continuously innovating to deliver consistent quality products respond to and anticipate the needs of our consumers.   
We engage with partners to develop new products that reflect modern tastes, leading trends, and evolving consumer preferences.

Partnerships

Kraft Heinz also strives to be at the forefront of ingredient and nutrition innovation and 
collaborates extensively with academia and other stakeholders to discover novel ingredients 
and products. 

For example, Kraft Heinz partnered with scientists at the Wyss Institute at Harvard University 
to create a micro-encapsulated enzyme product that can convert sugar to healthy fiber in 
the human gut. This enzyme has been engineered to only activate when it encounters a rise 
in pH, such as that which occurs in the transition from the human stomach to the intestines. 
Crucially, this product can be incorporated into existing food recipes without modifying their 
sugar content but reduces the amount of sugar absorbed into the bloodstream, thus producing 
gut-healthy prebiotic fiber. The team is currently extensively testing the enzyme with the hope 
to launch a startup company to offer the product for sale to food producers.

The NotCompany Partnership – Not your  average joint venture

The Kraft Heinz Not Company  – “Not your average” joint venture. In early 2022, we entered an exciting 
joint venture with The Not Company (NotCo) to reimagine global food production. The joint venture 
will leverage the inherent strengths of both companies. NotCo brings its patented, first-of-its-kind 
technology and proven artificial intelligence (AI) solutions, while Kraft Heinz offers its iconic brand 
portfolio and scale, to develop delicious plant-based versions of beloved Kraft Heinz products at a 
level of speed, taste, quality, and scale yet to be seen in the industry. Both Kraft Heinz and NotCo 
share a desire to change the world for the better and believe that working together they will accelerate 
adoption of plant-based foods. While interest in plant-based foods is surging, barriers in taste, variety, 
and availability remain. Utilizing NotCo AI technology and an agile approach to innovation, The Kraft 
Heinz Not Company has made significant progress in addressing these consumer needs, developing 
plant-based replicas for animal products with plant-based ingredients that don’t sacrifice taste, 
functionality, or the eating experience. 

“The joint venture is a critical step in the transformation of our product portfolio and a 
tremendous addition to our brand design-to-value capabilities ... we look forward to bringing 
delicious plant-based products that can be enjoyed by all in the future.”   

– Miguel Patricio, CEO Kraft Heinz

At Kraft Heinz, We are consumer obsessed! We have listened very closely to conscious consumers who have been interested in more plant-based 
options to add to their cart. As such, we have been delivering on our goal to increase our plant-based offerings though exciting innovation and 
alternatives to our most iconic and well-loved products.  

Heinz Beanz Liberation 

Philadelphia Plant-Based 

At Kraft Heinz we are in the midst of a Beanz Liberation. 
Our goal is to finally take our humble bean out of the 
can, harnessing its versatility, great taste and nutritional 
power. We are making a range of delicious, convenient and 
plant-based products accessible for everyone in the frozen 
category and beyond.  

We offer a range of delicious plant-based products like 
our Heinz Beanz Burgers made from haricot, cannellini 
and black beans (winner of Product of the Year awards in the U.K.) and our range of Heinz 
Beanz Bowls, such as Smoky Chilli and Beanz Fragrant Coconut Bowl (finalist in the 2022 
Grocer New Product Awards). We also launched a range of Heinz Beanz Nuggets helping 
parents who want reduce meat intake for their family and to make mealtimes delicious and 
nutritious. 

In 2022, Kraft Heinz also became a founding member of the Beans is How coalition, a global 
campaign with the ambitious goal to double the global consumption of beans, legumes, 
and pulses in the next five years and amplify their importance as a simple, nutritious, and 
affordable solution to health and environmental challenges.

Philadelphia, one of our most beloved brands, will 
be releasing a plant-based version of its iconic cream 
cheese. The product contains coconut oil to achieve that 
memorable creamy texture Philadelphia is known for along 
with potato starch and faba bean protein. This product 
began a limited release in 2022 and is expected to be 
launched nationally in the U.S. in 2023. 

Kraft NotCheese

Kraft Heinz and NotCo launched a plant-based version of 
the iconic Kraft American cheese. This is the first product 
from our joint venture with NotCo (See page 33 for more 
details on this partnership). The product tastes and melts 
like cheese and will come in American, provolone and 
cheddar varieties. Key ingredients include coconut oil  
and chickpea protein. After a successful test market in  
2022, NotCheese Slices will be rolling out nationally in  
the U.S. in 2023.

2022 HEALTHY LIVING HIGHLIGHTS

Capri Sun® cuts sugar by an average 
of 40 percent across the brand

In August 2022, Kraft Heinz launched a new formulation of  
Capri Sun beverages in the United States with an average of 40% 
less sugar than the prior version. Each single serving will now have 
on average, 8g of total sugars and 5g of added sugars. Our scientists 
spent several years perfecting the reformulation to achieve a 
significant decrease in sugar while maintaining the iconic, delicious 
taste that earned Capri Sun the title of kids’ #1 favorite juice drink. 
Still with the great taste kids love, our major breakthrough was using 
monk fruit concentrate, a natural sweetener that is gaining popularity 
in the food and beverage industry.

Heinz Made for Veggiez

Golden Circle® Refreshers

Quero Sodium reduction journey

Heinz launched a range of sauces to elevate the taste of 
vegetables and to help time-strapped consumers to create 
simple and delicious plant-based meals — from patatas bravas 
to miso-glazed aubergines. The team developed these sauces 
after noticing a lack of sauce offerings in the market designed to 
pair with vegetables, despite the growing consumer demand for 
plant-based diets. The sauces are vegan, gluten-free and contain 
no artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives. Perfect for dipping, 
stir-frying, roasting, and marinating vegetables, each sauce is 
inspired by a different world cuisine to help you make all kinds of 
tasty recipes.

Golden Circle Refreshers are exciting new low sugar fruit drinks 
launched in Australia in 2022. Golden Circle Refreshers are a 
refreshing combination of still water, fruit juice and fruity flavors, 
and are available in four delicious varieties — Berry Burst, 
Tropical Sunrise, Wild Waterfall, and Cool Crush. Refreshers 
fruit drinks are low calorie and low in sugar, with no more than 
2.5g sugars per 100ml and have no artificial colors, flavors, or 
preservatives.

A beloved staple of Brazilian consumers, Quero prides itself 
in its commitment to quality and has been on a journey of 
nutritional transformation. In 2022, the brand reduced sodium 
by an incredible 50 percent across its canned vegetable category 
(corn, peas, tomato sauce) and 15 percent across its pasta sauce 
category. These initiatives collectively removed approximately 
880 tons of salt across the Quero portfolio.

FOOD SAFETY & QUALITY 

Kraft Heinz is a globally trusted producer of delicious foods. We are passionate about food safety and quality, and we will not compromise on it. Our 
Quality & Food Safety Management System gives us and our consumers a high level of confidence in the safety and quality of the food on our plates.

We are continuously investing in quality and food safety processes and constantly improving 
our testing and controls as well as the reliability of our equipment. We are pioneers in 
deployment of advanced analytics and AI to predict and eliminate future failures and events 
potentially affecting product safety and waste.

Driving Compliance Beyond Industry Regulations  
and Standards

In order to drive compliance and food safety beyond industry standards, we established Golden 
and Platinum Rules that are part of our DNA. The level of compliance of our own sites and 
vendors we work with is continuously monitored and measured against these rules.

Our Best-in-Class Food Safety & Quality Systems

We implement a consistent, comprehensive food safety and product quality management 
process across our global supply chain. Through this, Kraft Heinz is committed to meeting 
regulatory compliance and industry standards. Our food safety and product quality 
management process has been designed by us for us. We utilize leading methodologies to 
ensure food is manufactured safely, complies with all applicable regulations, and meets or 
exceeds our own high-quality standards we’ve set for our products. 

Our quality and food safety management system helps ensure our owned factories and our 
vendors are also compliant with Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) recognized certification 
(e.g., FSSC 22000). Many of our factories undergo third party audits and achieve third party 
certification to demonstrate this. Kraft Heinz also serves on the GFSI Steering Committee 
(alongside major producers and retailers), working through challenges to enable the GFSI 
objectives, including governance and technical working groups.

Focus on Excellence and Continuous Improvement

In order to ensure constant improvement of our food safety and product quality management 
system, we also monitor other external metrics including product recall, serious incidents, and 
consumer complaints. We are driving continuous improvement in our processes and systems 
which results in very high First Time Right scores and therefore reduces product waste. 

Kraft Heinz quality, operations, and other functions are deploying a transformational 
management system focused on the principles of transforming the culture and mindset of our 
teams through best-in-class collaboration, teamwork, waste reduction, efficiency, and product 
safety.

RESPONSIBLE MARKETING 

Kraft Heinz is committed to marketing and advertising its products in a responsible and transparent manner. 

Employees responsible for creating, approving or placing marketing materials for Kraft Heinz 
have primary responsibility for compliance with Company guidelines, and such marketing 
team members are formally trained regarding requirements and expectations pursuant to 
various marketing policies, including a Marketing to Kids Pledge. In the United States, Kraft 
Heinz abides by a comprehensive set of marketing to children standards: Children’s Food & 
Beverage Advertising Initiative (CFBAI), Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) 
and Children’s Advertising Review Unit (CARU). 

In Australia and New Zealand, Kraft Heinz has a rigorous cross-functional 
internal approval process for advertising and marketing material across digital, 
online, and physical media. This includes consideration and adherence to 
responsible marketing codes, such as:

The Australian Association of National Advertisers (AANA) Codes, including the 
Food and Beverages Advertising Code and Children’s Advertising Code.

As noted in our Pledge and CFBAI’s Core Principles, Kraft Heinz’s commitments relating to 
marketing to children include: 

The New Zealand Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) Codes, including the 
Advertising Standards Code and Children and Young People’s Advertising Code.

•  No advertising directed to children under 6 years of age;
•  Only qualified products which meet CFBAI’s uniform nutrition criteria may be 

marketed to children ages 6 to 12; 

•  Guidelines apply to media (e.g. TV, internet, radio, etc.) that is primarily directed to 

children;  

•  No in-school marketing below the university level.

Similarly, in Canada, Kraft Heinz complies with The Code for the Responsible Advertising of Food 
and Beverage Products to Children, which requires that any advertising of food and beverages 
primarily directed to children under the age of 13 satisfy certain established nutrition criteria. 

In Europe, we adhere to clear guidelines and requirements, including the U.K.’s OFCOM and 
Advertising Standards Authority, as well as the Netherlands Code of Conduct on Kids 
Marketing. 

The Codes’ requirements include:

•  Not undermining the importance of a healthy and active lifestyle nor 

the promotion of healthy balanced diets;

•  Not encouraging excessive food and beverage consumption through 
disproportionate portion sizes to the setting or as contrary to the 
dietary guidelines;

•  Not targeting children with advertising or sponsorship of ‘occasional’ 

food and beverage products.

Guidelines for Marketing  
Breast Milk Substitutes
We are committed to the health and well-being of mothers, infants, and young children. 
We support the WHO’s recommendation that babies are exclusively breastfed for the 
first six months of life, followed by the introduction of nutritionally adequate and safe 
complementary foods. The Company complies with the World Health Organization (WHO) 
International Code for Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes. To further demonstrate our 
positions and approach on the manufacture and marketing of breast-milk substitutes, 
Kraft Heinz has established and published its Policy on Breast-Milk Substitutes.

TRANSPARENCY & LABELING 

We have a responsibility to communicate information about our products to ensure that consumers can feel good about what they 
are feeding their families. At Kraft Heinz, we’re committed to being transparent and helping consumers make informed food and 
beverage choices, whether at home or at the grocery store.

Front of Pack Nutrition Labeling 

SmartLabel 

Consumers consistently say they want more information on how their food is made and what 
it contains. To address this need, we are voluntarily making our nutrition information easier for 
consumers to find by providing nutrition information on the front of our product packaging in 
certain markets.

Facts Up Front: U.S. 

We have widely implemented the Facts Up Front program for key Kraft Heinz products to help 
consumers plan nutritious meals for their family. This voluntary program was developed in 
the U.S. in 2011 to increase nutrition transparency and access by displaying calories, saturated 
fat, sugar, and sodium on the front of each package. The visual informs consumers about the 
nutrients in each product and how they fit into a balanced and healthy diet as part of the federal 
daily dietary advice.

Health Star Rating: Australia & New Zealand 

Kraft Heinz supports the voluntary Health Star Rating front-of-pack labelling system in 
Australia and New Zealand. The Health Star Rating system rates the overall nutritional profile 
of packaged foods using a strict calculation and assigns a rating from ½ a star to 5 stars. The 
Health Star Rating is an easy way to help consumers compare the nutrition of similar packaged 
foods and make healthier food choices. The Health Star Rating system was implemented 
in 2014 in Australia and New Zealand, and was developed by governments in collaboration 
with public health experts, the food industry, and consumer groups. Kraft Heinz continues to 
support and implement Health Star Ratings on a number of our packaged food products in 
Australia and New Zealand.

In the U.S. and Canada, we provide product information through the 
SmartLabel website. Responding to the informational needs of today’s 
consumer, the SmartLabel initiative enables Kraft Heinz to provide consumers 
with the detailed information they seek about our products. More than 2,600 
Kraft Heinz products have been listed on smartlabel.org, including Boca,  
Capri Sun, Classico, Gevalia, Mio, Jell-O, and many others, with plans to add 
more for both the U.S. and Canada. 

Traffic Light: United Kingdom 

Our journey toward more transparency involves listening to our stakeholders. 
By participating in the Traffic Light program in the U.K., we hope to provide 
consistency in labeling to U.K. consumers. Under the traffic light system, food 
and drink labels show whether levels of sugar, salt, and fat are high, medium 
or low using red, amber and green traffic light colors — and is based on the 
amount per 100g.

HEALTHY LIVING RECIPES

As part of our continuous efforts to support the needs of today’s consumers to prepare, serve, and enjoy delicious snacks and meals, our culinary 
teams are developing new and innovative recipes. Our internal dietitians and nutritionists have established criteria to help consumers identify 
recipes which fit within relevant guidelines for healthy eating. 

United States and Canada: Our websites in the United States (My Food and Family) and 
Canada (Kraft Canada) offer consumers the ability to find recipes tailored to their specific tastes 
and dietary needs. Our Healthy Living recipe collection features recipes that meet nutritional 
guidelines established by our registered dietitians. We plan to continue expanding our content 
to meet the diverse and changing needs of consumers.

Europe: The Kraft Heinz Nutrition Recipe Guidelines provide guidance in developing nutritious 
and balanced meals using Kraft Heinz products, while minimizing less desirable ingredients 
and promoting responsible portion sizes. 

New Zealand: Our Food in a Minute from Wattie’s is one of New Zealand’s most popular recipe 
sites reaching approximately half the population every year. Focused on becoming the go-to 
resource for foodies and beginner cooks alike, our recipes are trend and insight driven and 
feature our wide variety of products. With hundreds of recipes for every occasion, from quick 
dinner ideas to meals for special occasions, Food in a Minute has something for everyone. We 
also have a ‘Healthier Pick’ recipe collection, which has been reviewed and assessed by our 
nutritionists and meets our requirements for energy, added sugar, sodium, saturated fat, fiber, 
and vegetable content. Our nutritional criteria are published online for consumers to access, in 
line with our commitments to transparency and supporting healthy living.

WE OWN OUR SAFETY

Safety in the Workplace 

Kraft Heinz is committed to providing a healthy, safe, and secure workplace for employees, 
contractors, and all people who visit our facilities. Safety Management is built into our fully 
integrated Kraft Heinz Management System (KHMS), combining best-practice safety principles 
with other operational functions in a continuous improvement framework. The Environmental, 
Health, and Safety (EHS) pillar within KHMS states clear expectations and practical steps to 
manage risk and avoid injuries, and requirements are expected to be followed in every Kraft 
Heinz facility. We track and measure implementation through internal audits, with results 
reflected in Management-by-Objectives KPIs and Factory Championship rankings. Due to 
robust site-level implementation, Kraft Heinz improved its safety KPIs over the last year, 
representing some of the best results among our industry peers. 

Severity Prevention

The severity prevention indicator provides significant input to our global EHS program. 
It establishes a culture of intervention that encourages all employees and contractors to 
proactively identify and report near misses and unsafe conditions and behaviors.  In this way, 
we can anticipate preventative actions to address these situations before they escalate to an 
actual injury. 

We study near–miss data thoroughly and have identified the top three precursors to accidents: 
safe access to and securing of machinery, powered industrial vehicles, and hazardous 
materials. The identification of these precursors has enabled us to focus on the instances 
that could lead to severe injuries or fatalities and prevent them. Our leadership is engaged in 
understanding how theses precursors may harm our people and operations and ensures the 
allocation of resources to mitigate or eliminate risks.  

In addition, Kraft Heinz manufacturing employees have access to many tools 
and programs to help keep safety in mind. These include STOP. THINK. ACT., 
a program to support the proactive reporting of near misses and unsafe 
conditions or behaviors, and Safety Triggers, a tool to help employees 
anticipate the potential risks of their tasks by taking a step back and identifying 
potential safety triggers prior to starting their task.

Total Recordable Incident Rate 

2022 TRIR

Our compiled worldwide Total Recordable Incident 
Rate (TRIR) is a medical incident rate based on the U.S. 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 
record-keeping criteria (injuries per 200,000 hours). 
2022 saw continued progress in our Worldwide Safety 
Performance, resulting in a 0.53 TRIR, improving approximately 15 percent 
as compared to 2021. Kraft Heinz is proud of its safety track record, having 
delivered year-over-year incident reductions since its inception. We will keep 
strengthening our safety culture towards our goal of zero loss.

ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP

At Kraft Heinz, environmental stewardship is key to our focus on sustainable growth. It begins with our 
operational footprint, where we actively strive to conserve water and energy, reduce emissions, minimize 
waste, and make our packaging sustainable. Our manufacturing facilities are under our operational control 
and can consume substantial amounts of resources, so we focus significant efforts on environmental 
stewardship inside of our walls. We also prioritize reducing our impact across our value chain both upstream 
with our suppliers and downstream with customers and consumers.

ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY GOALS  

Kraft Heinz is committed to reducing its operational environmental footprint. We have prioritized projects across our global manufacturing  
network in the areas of water conservation, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), waste reduction, and packaging.

100%  

New Goal: net zero GHG 
emissions by 2050 and 50% 
reduction by 2030 reduction 
across all three scopes with a 
2021 base year

base year

20% 

Decrease in waste to landfill 
intensity (kilogram per metric ton 
production) by 2025 with a 2019 
base year

In 2022, we reduced water use intensity by 8.7 percent for all facilities, and by 16.07 
percent in high-risk watershed areas. We also reduced energy use intensity by 4.22 
percent, and waste to landfill intensity by 18.40 percent. This performance was 
primarily driven by acquisitions and divestitures in 2022 that readjusted our baseline 
year calculations.* We are working to ensure that any new acquisitions have a strong 
strategy in place to improve their environmental footprint and are further pushing 
our global facilities to continue to drive progress and share best practices with one 
another. We remain confident we have set up the proper management systems (read 
more about our Kraft Heinz Management system to the right) and governance structure, 
and are leveraging appropriate resources to keep us on course toward achieving our 
manufacturing ESG goals by 2025. 

We continue to recognize the significant environmental impacts a growing population 
can have, and we remain steadfast in balancing production processes that can meet 
global food demand with efficient operation. Through thorough assessment and strong 
management processes and routines, we see opportunities for improvement at various 

stages of our operations, and we continue to learn from external perspectives, as well 
as ourselves, by continuously fostering efficiency improvements in an environment of 
collaboration, ownership, and innovation. The Kraft Heinz Management System (KHMS) 
is a set of standard practices and routines that is tailored to advance our operational 
excellence journey. KHMS is one of the key drivers of our sustainable manufacturing 
strategy as it guides the implementation of practices to reduce water use, energy use, 
GHG emissions, and waste output. These practices help guide our manufacturing teams, 
continuously challenge themselves toward our strategic goals, and learn better ways to 
improve and sustain their results.

* In 2022, the combination of divestitures and acquisition passed our 5 percent materiality threshold and thus data from these facilities were added and removed respectively from our baseline 
year. In total we have added one facility (as part of our Assan Foods purchase) and removed 11 facilities divested between 2019 and 2022 across the globe from our baseline year. Please note 
that environmental data for years between the base year and reporting year are not recalculated as per our Basis of Reporting for key ESG indicators. 

Kraft Heinz Management System 
The Kraft Heinz Management System (KHMS) standard practices are organized 
into eight pillars, each with its own specific function but simultaneously 
interconnected to drive sustainable efficiency improvements. Since adopting this 
framework, we have completed many innovative and impactful projects across the 
world and made significant positive progress toward our ESG goals. The following 
pages describe our progress and examples of successful projects across each of 
our environmental goals.

Water is fundamental to all life and business either directly or indirectly. Making high-
quality products requires that we begin with high-quality ingredients, of which fresh 
quality water is a key input. As a food and beverage company, having access to sufficient 
amounts of high-quality fresh water, both now and in the future, is critical to our business. 
Water is used in many areas of our value chain. It is a vital input for growing various 
agricultural ingredients we use in our products. We also use water as a direct ingredient 
in many of our products and as a key part of our manufacturing, cleaning, and sanitation 
processes. Access to high-quality water is pivotal for us to achieve our high standards 
of food safety and quality. High-quality water will continue to be a vital component 
throughout our value chain.

Kraft Heinz is committed to water stewardship in each aspect of our business. Within 
our operational boundary, we are committed to reducing our water use intensity by 20 
percent across manufacturing facilities in high-risk watershed areas and 15 percent across 
all manufacturing facilities by 2025 with a 2019 baseline. Our water reduction strategy 
consists of a variety of aspects, including partnerships with water efficiency experts, water 
recycling programs, and best practice sharing among our global facilities. 

Across our supply chain, we manage water risk as part of our commitment 
to supplier sustainability. In general, all Kraft Heinz suppliers are asked to 
abide by our Supplier Guiding Principles, which include stipulations on 
responsible water stewardship. For key commodities, we have more in-
depth mechanisms to oversee water stewardship such as our Sustainable 
Agricultural Practices Manual, sustainably-sourced tomatoes goal, and 
grower audits (see page 67 for more details on our sustainable agriculture 
program).

WATER USE & CONSERVATION (CONT.)

 2022 Progress 

Looking Ahead

In 2022, we improved water use intensity by 8.7 percent (all facilities) and 16.07 percent 
(high-risk watershed areas) compared to our 2019 baseline. We achieved this through 
furthering our water recycling and efficiency programs and rolling these programs  
out globally.

At Kraft Heinz, we are always striving to further understand risks and manage 
water stewardship across our value chain. We intend to update our global water 
risk assessment of our manufacturing facilities in 2023 and release a global water 
policy in the next few years. We will share more details in future reporting.

Our Escalon facility in California is a long-time champion 
of water circularity and has incorporated innovative ways 
of improving its water footprint. The facility produces 
approximately 200-350 million pounds of tomato 
products each year which go on to make many products 
such as tomato paste, puree, and pizza sauce for our food 
service customers. Recognizing that tomatoes are made 
of approximately 95 percent water, the facility developed 
innovative ways to extract and reuse this excess water 
through evaporation to run boilers and the facility’s 
can washing system. The facility generates approximately 600,000 gallons of water from 
tomatoes daily when at full capacity, which significantly reduces its reliance on Escalon’s 
municipal water supply. The facility also redirects excess solid waste from the tomatoes 
to other beneficial uses such as soil amendments and animal feed resulting in virtually no 
tomato-related waste at the facility.

Improving Water Use  
at our Shanghai Facility

An excellent example of how we’re achieving this 
progress is in our Shanghai facility that makes 
many well-loved products for the Asia Pacific 
region such as our Master brand soy sauce. 
The facility successfully reduced their water 
intensity by 20 percent compared to their 2019 
baseline, three years in advance of the  2025 goal. The team follows three simple 
principles: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and achieved the goal through effective 
condensate recovery, a bottle rinsing recycling program, ‘clean-in-place’ recycle 
and optimization, environmental management system digitalization and better 
measurement and monitoring practices which together save approximately 66 
million liters of water a year.

WATER RISK ASSESSMENT

We conduct a water risk assessment of our global manufacturing operations every 2-5 years with interim assessments as needed. These assessments leverage the World Resources Institute’s (WRI) Aqueduct tool along 
with the subject matter expertise of an external consulting partner. We then evaluate our watershed conditions to validate economic scarcity factors not fully addressed by the database indicators. For each of our 
evaluated facilities we identify physical, reputational, social, and water quality risks. 

Our water risk assessment was last updated in 2020. As of December 2022, of the 78 manufacturing facilities we operate, 18 facilities had some degrees of elevated water stress. Water use from these facilities is derived 
from approximately 63 percent municipal, 27 percent bore, and 9 percent surface. In addition to water reduction targets, we also developed a plan that focuses on high-risk areas to drive improvements and mitigate 
risks, and to provide updates into our ongoing risk evaluation. We evaluate any interim mitigation strategies as needed. We are planning to update our water risk assessment for our manufacturing facilities in 2023.

ENERGY USE & CONSERVATION

Reduce energy use intensity by 15% across our manufacturing  
facilities by 2025 (per metric ton of product made). 

PROGRESS

-4.2%

Manufacturing our products to finished packaged goods and maintaining our highest 
standards of safety, quality, and sanitation, all while providing a comfortable and secure 
environment for our employees to work, can consume significant amounts of energy. In 
this type of interdependent environment, we know many opportunities exist to reduce 
energy consumption through operational optimization. Our scale provides us with a 
unique ability to test concepts at various facilities, learn, prove outcomes, and then 
implement successful energy-savings initiatives across our business. 

We are on a journey of continuous improvement to identify our opportunities in this 
area and capitalize on them. Kraft Heinz is committed to reducing energy intensity 
by 15 percent across our manufacturing facilities with a 2019 baseline. Our energy 
reduction strategy includes a variety of aspects such as advanced monitoring and the 
implementation of our good operating practice guidelines such as machinery upgrades, 
heat recovery projects, and improved condensate return. 

2022 Progress

In 2022, we improved energy use intensity by 4.22 percent across our manufacturing 
facilities compared to our 2019 baseline. Our progress was largely driven by significant 
acquisitions and divestitures in 2022. While we are working on improving the energy 
efficiency of our newly acquired facilities, our current sites have been continuously 
improving their energy strategy through efficiency measures and equipment upgrades. 

Our Northgate, Australia facility has been making our iconic Golden Circle juice and 
canned products loved by consumers for 75 years. Last year, the facility initiated a 
boiler blowdown improvement project to further improve their energy efficiency. The 
project redirected water that was previously discharged after usage in the boiler due to 
impurities. By installing on-facility tubing and recycling systems, this boiler blowdown 

water was then recycled and mixed in with fresh water coming into the boiler. This 
project resulted in significant heat recovery which reduces the facility’s reliance on non-
renewable resources for heating. 

Our Mont Royal, Canada facility invested in a program to better identify and repair 
air leaks across the facility. The initiative included activities such as utilizing better 
monitoring technologies to diagnose air leaks and embedding more consistent 
inspection practices throughout the year. As a result, the facility saved approximately 
885,000 kilowatt hours of electricity in 2022.

Looking Ahead

We are rolling out a robust energy reduction roadmap in line with our global net zero 
strategy. Our goal is to have better control of our energy usage by in-housing critical 
production processes. While this may diminish progress on our energy intensity goal 
in the short-term, we are committed to delivering energy and GHG reductions through 
electrification, heat recycling, and equipment retrofitting older machinery in the  
longer-term.

In 2023, we are focusing on energy roadmaps related to our largest global sites.

NET ZERO AND SCIENCE BASED TARGETS

Achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050,  
halving same by 2030.

PROGRESS

At Kraft Heinz, we have pledged to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions 
across our operational footprint (Scope 1 and Scope 2) and entire global value chain 
(Scope 3) by 2050, establishing our major commitment to contribute to global efforts to 
reduce the ongoing threat of climate change. As a milestone on our path to achieve net 
zero emissions, consistent with the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), we will target 
a near-term absolute emissions reduction of 50 percent by 2030 across all three scopes 
with a 2021 base year. 

A considerable portion of our total carbon footprint is produced from our Scope 3 
emissions, and more specifically originate in our supply chain (see graphs to the right 
for emissions breakdown). Agricultural and ingredient-related emissions are particularly 
significant and provide the greatest opportunity for reduction through increased 
collaboration and transitioning to regenerative agriculture.

2022 Progress

We began a partnership with external climate experts to help us define our pathway to net 
zero. In late 2022 we worked to define technical decarbonization pathways for Kraft Heinz 
and develop our approach to addressing product carbon intensity through portfolio 
growth choices and product formulation. During this process, we worked very closely 
with our executive leadership team on the development of our roadmap. 

•  Building the cost of carbon into our financial planning and investment decisions;
•  Further aligning internal performance incentives with net zero targets;
•  Transitioning to net zero manufacturing facilities and improving our logistics 

footprint.

Sourcing Localization Initiative

A significant portion of our GHG emissions reside in 
our upstream transportation and distribution network. 
To reduce our operational footprint, Kraft Heinz began 
a journey to improve the efficiency of our sourcing 
through localization initiatives in our Egypt and Eastern 
Europe operations. Kraft Heinz teams worked to build 
capacity with local suppliers in the regions to ensure 
a stable supply and reduce transportation miles while 
also improving price and reducing supply risk. For 
example, thanks to localization efforts launched this 
year in Poland, we are proud that next year, almost 100 percent of tomato paste used in 
our Pudliszki branded finished goods will be sourced from more than 150 small farms that 
are within 60 kilometers of our production facility.  As we look to the future, we intend to 
further improve localizing and regionalizing procurement of key commodities.

Key focus areas of our net zero program include:

•  Reducing the impact of enteric emissions by partnering to scale methane inhibitors  

and anaerobic digesters for meat and dairy ingredients;

Looking Ahead

•  Revising sourcing specifications for key commodities including regenerative 

agriculture, deforestation and conversion-free commitments and localization of 
sourcing;

•  Transitioning to more circular and lower carbon packaging; 

While we have made incredible progress in 2022, we have substantial work ahead of us. In 
2023, we are working to further embed our net zero strategy within our 10-year strategic 
plan and submit our targets and roadmaps to the Science Based Targets initiative. We are 
exploring investments in critical technologies including carbon removals, where we have 
clear scientific evidence of material GHG emissions reduction. 

We are continually striving to improve the accuracy of our Scope 3 emissions reporting. There were several material amendments made to our 2021 
Scope 3 figures due to data error, improved data quality, inclusion of FLAG emissions, and/or improvements in calculation methodology.

RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY

Kraft Heinz is committed to operating responsibly and doing our part in the critical global efforts to reduce the harmful 
impacts of climate change. 

Procure majority of electricity from renewable  
sources by 2025.

PROGRESS

14.21%

A big component of this commitment is both reducing how much energy we consume, 
and thereby reducing the associated emissions where applicable, as well as rethinking 
our energy sources and supporting to expedite the energy transition. As such, we are 
committed to procuring the majority of electricity from renewable sources by 2025.

2022 Progress 

In 2022 we made major headway on our renewable energy commitments toward our 2025 
goal. Our first large scale renewable electricity supply started in June 2022 and by year-
end, approximately 15 percent of our U.S. manufacturing facility electricity consumption 
for the year was supplied from renewable sources. Globally in 2022, we contracted 
renewable electricity capacity that will come online in multiple phases over the next two 
years equating to approximately 46 percent of our current manufacturing facility demand. 

BHE Renewables Investment 

We also signed a virtual power purchase agreement  
(“vPPA”) with BHE Renewables, a Berkshire Hathaway Energy business, for our U.S. 
operations, which make up a significant portion of our 
global energy usage. This partnership will initially cover 
approximately 30 percent of the energy usage at our U.S. 
manufacturing facilities; and at the start of 2025, this amount is expected to increase 
to approximately 60 percent. The renewable energy is delivered by BHE Renewables’ 
158-megawatt Gopher Creek wind farm in Scurry County, TX.

Repsol Wind Energy Investment 

In June 2022 we announced a 12-year vPPA 
with Repsol, a global multi-energy company 
operating across more than 20 countries and 
based in Madrid, Spain. This was our first investment in wind energy, and 
we expect to source over 90 gigawatt hours per year of renewable energy 
from Repsol’s largest wind project, Delta II (Aragon, Spain) – equivalent 
to powering approximately 90 percent of Kraft Heinz’s European 
manufacturing facilities, which is the majority of our European load. The 
vPPA is expected to generate enough renewable electricity to power 
approximately 25,000 average EU households per year at its peak.

Looking Ahead

We are excited by our progress in 2022 and confident that we will reach our 
2025 renewable electricity procurement goal. We are currently identifying 
and implementing new renewable energy projects across the world to 
support our net zero commitments. Kraft Heinz is planning to expand 
through impactful projects, offering verification and additionality to the 
build-out of renewable electricity generation capacity, and supporting 
decarbonization of local grids and our operations.

WASTE REDUCTION

Reduce waste to landfill intensity by 20% across our manufacturing facilities 
by 2025 (per metric ton of product made). 

PROGRESS

-18.40%

At Kraft Heinz, we think about waste holistically. To source, produce, and package food 
and beverage products requires several inputs and outputs related to ingredients and 
byproducts, material flows, and end-of-life packaging considerations. When we think 
about materials and food-related flows, detailed waste evaluations help us identify where 
we can ‘prevent, reduce, repurpose, and recycle.’ In fact, our owned global manufacturing 
facilities divert more than 90 percent of our solid waste to recycling or byproducts usage. 

Kraft Heinz is committed to reducing our waste to landfill intensity by 20 percent across 
manufacturing facilities with a 2019 baseline. Our waste reduction strategy includes a 
variety of levers including waste minimization and diversion to beneficial use. 

2022 Progress 

In 2022, we improved waste intensity by 18.4 percent compared to our 2019 baseline. Our 
facilities have been steadfast in their waste minimization through the identification and 
reallocation of waste streams for beneficial use, primarily for food and packaging waste. 

We are proud to share that our Elst, Netherlands and Pasuruan, Indonesia facilities were 
certified as Zero Waste to Landfill in 2022. 

As an example of our positive waste progress, our facility in Pasuruan, Indonesia – where 
many well-loved favorites from our ABC brand are produced – achieved Zero Waste to 
Landfill status verified by an independent third-party. The facility diverts its waste to 
various beneficial uses. For example, all byproducts from the production process (such 
as soy cake and soy residue) are diverted to the animal feed industry. Unused packaging 
is recycled and reused where applicable. The facility also initiated an innovative 

collaboration with Re>Pal, a sustainable pallet manufacturer that creates zero 
waste pallets by fully utilizing difficult to recycle plastics with their unique 
ThermoFusion™ technology. We trialed the use of ABC and Heinz pouches in 
Re>Pal’s HD1210 pallet which proved to be a success. We are now looking to use 
these pallets in our own logisitics program.

Looking Ahead

As we look to the future, we are continuing to prioritize key global facilities for waste 
elimination. Our facilities continue to seek opportunities to reduce the waste we generate 
and divert waste for beneficial reuse and other by-products.

We are also focused on improving manufacturing yield and thus reducing and eliminating 
waste early in the production process.

Reducing Waste  
with Northstar Recycling

In North America, we work closely with our partner Northstar 
Recycling to support our journey towards reducing waste to 
landfill across our manufacturing facilities. In 2022, our Fresno 
facility diverted approximately 49 metric tons (8 percent of 
their landfill waste stream) of defective or unusable packaging 
from the landfill towards beneficial uses. To accomplish this, the team began 
baling this material and worked with Northstar to identify a recycling stream which 
converted the packaging into reusable corner board dunnage product. In addition, 
we also worked extensively to develop ways to prevent sending meat waste to 
the landfill across four of our other facilities. In the U.S., meat waste must be 
landfilled by law unless there is an appropriate permit in place with the USDA. 
We worked together with Northstar to secure the appropriate permits to allow for 
this waste to be diverted from the landfill and sent to anaerobic digesters and 
composters for beneficial reuse such as methane capture and soil applications. 
In 2022 alone, we diverted approximately 1,209 metrics tons of meat waste from 
the landfill.

REDUCING FOOD WASTE

According to the United Nations Environmental Program, it is estimated that 
approximately 14 percent of food produced is lost between harvest and retail. Food waste 
is detrimental to the environment, leading to wasted resources like energy, water, land, 
and increased greenhouse gas emissions. As the population grows, the pressure on our 
water, land, and energy will only increase. 

Food waste is an important priority at Kraft Heinz. We focus on the entire value chain 
in terms of where food waste can be reduced. This includes sourcing, production, 
transportation, shelf life, use, and end-of-life. We analyze and test how processes, 
products, and packaging can be optimized. We investigate where unneeded byproducts or 
unwanted finished products can find other uses versus going to landfills, such as beneficial 
land application and product donations to those in need. 

Kraft Heinz has joined together with industry peers to eliminate food waste globally. Kraft 
Heinz United Kingdom and Kraft Heinz Canada have both joined national commitments to 
reduce food waste.

U.K.: In the U.K., Kraft Heinz is a member of the Food Waste Reduction Roadmap (FWRR) 
initiative. Hundreds of food-related organizations have committed to supporting this 
initiative, which aims to reduce food waste in the U.K. by 50 percent by 2030. The initiative 
is run by IGD (a food research and training organization) and WRAP (a nonprofit focused 
on sustainability) to verify data and encourage best practices. Kraft Heinz committed to 
setting a target for food waste reduction across our own operations towards the broader 
goal, and to also work in partnership with suppliers and consumers to that end. WRAP 
committed to report results in 2019, 2022, 2026 and issue a final report in 2031 against the 
50 percent reduction goal. 

Canada: In Canada, Kraft Heinz has joined seven other companies in a pledge to reduce 
food waste in operations by 50 percent by 2025. Kraft Heinz will use the globally recognized 
Food Loss and Waste Accounting and Reporting Standard to report our progress. Kraft 

Heinz Canada is also a member of Loblaw’s 10x20x30 Initiative, a key effort of the 
Consumer Goods Forum’s global Coalition of Action on Food Waste.

In 2022, Kraft Heinz joined the Consumer Good Forum (CGF) Food Waste Coalition of 
Action. CGF is the only CEO-led forum bringing together entities across the consumer 
goods value chain to foster collaborative engagement across the industry. The aim of 
the Food Waste Coalition of Action is ‘to halve per capita global food waste at the retail 
and consumer levels, and to reduce food losses along production, and supply chains 
including post- harvest losses.’ Through this membership, Kraft Heinz is working to set 
a robust food waste strategy and target. Progress on this topic will be shared in future 
reporting.

Diverting Waste in Canada

Our Canada team has been leading the way on diverting 
food waste in its manufacturing operations. Our Mont 
Royal facility in Quebec typically generates approximately 
3,000 metric tons of waste destined for the landfill each 
year. To improve its waste profile, the facility completed 
a full audit of its waste streams. Recognizing that food 
scraps were a major source of waste, employees were 
then trained to separate organic food waste so that a clean 
stream of organic waste could be sent to a bio-digestor that 
anaerobically digests this waste into biogas for electricity, 
fuel, and gas production. In 2022, the facility successfully 
reduced its waste to landfill by 21 percent compared to our 
2019 baseline year, ahead of our 2025 waste to landfill target.

PROGRESS

Our comprehensive approach to packaging seeks to meet extensive packaging regulations, aims to cut waste, conserve natural resources, ensure 
food safety and quality, and satisfy our consumers. Our team of experts collaborates with suppliers and external packaging specialists to design better 
packaging that incorporates more recycled and recyclable materials. We partner with a variety of leading organizations and coalitions to explore technical, 
end-of-life, and infrastructure solutions. 

At Kraft Heinz, we aim to make 100 percent of our packaging globally recyclable, reusable, or compostable by 2025. We have partnered with environmental 
consultancy group Lorax EPI to better understand how much of our packaging is recyclable, reusable, and compostable. The majority of our packaging 
is paper-based, glass, or metal materials that are recyclable. The other portion of our packaging is mostly made up of flexible plastic films or rigid plastic 
containers. Through 2022, 87 percent* of our global packaging portfolio was recyclable, reusable, or compostable.

While we are proud of our accomplishment, we are cognizant of the road ahead to convert the remaining part of our portfolio to be recyclable, reusable, 
and/or compostable. At this time, the majority of Kraft Heinz’s non-recyclable portfolio is made up of films and flexible materials, a critical material in 
food packaging for convenience, cost, and food safety. In the coming years, we are evaluating this part of the portfolio to ensure alignment with design 
for recycling guidelines, which will further push us towards our goal. We are also working closely with industry groups to collectively improve recycling 
infrastructure and explore alternatives. 

We are also strengthening our packaging commitments by continuing to transition our portfolio towards both reducing our packaging and transitioning 
towards more sustainable packaging alternatives. We plan to roll out an ambitious virgin plastic reduction goal which will be available on our website in 
2023.

DESIGNING BETTER PACKAGING

We consider the appearance, functionality, cost, and environmental impact of packaging design, focusing on product 
integrity through production, distribution, shelf life, and end-of-life. 

Exploring the Heinz Ketchup 
Bottle of Tomorrow

Over the past few years, we collaborated with 
Pulpex to develop a paper-based, renewable, 
and recyclable bottle made from 100 percent 
sustainably sourced wood pulp. We are proud 
to be the first sauce brand to test the potential 
of Pulpex’s sustainable paper bottle packaging 
for our range of world-famous condiments.

Through this incredible partnership, we 
developed a prototype to test how Pulpex’s cutting-edge innovation could be used for 
Heinz Tomato Ketchup bottles and other packaging formats in years to come. 

Pulpex’s current data indicates the carbon footprint of Pulpex bottles is materially less 
than glass and plastic on a bottle-by-bottle basis. Once used, they are also expected to 
be widely and readily recyclable in paper waste streams. The next step in the process 
will involve prototype testing to assess performance before testing with consumers and 
bringing the bottle to market.

DESIGNING FOR RECYCLABILITY

 At Kraft Heinz, we are always looking to improve the 
recyclability of our packaging. Our iconic condiment 
sachets are a critical part of our portfolio. Sachets are 
challenging to recycle in some infrastructures, due to 
their material make up. In 2022, we worked hard to 
improve the recyclability of our sachets in Europe and 
created a brand-new design utilizing CEFLEX Designing 
for Circular Economy Guidelines. The newly designed 
sachet packaging is also made with the equivalent of 
35 percent recycled material, on a mass balance basis, 
and is certified by the International Sustainability & 
Carbon Certification, a third-party. While not yet widely-recyclable based on the current 
infrastructure, this sachet designed for recycling will be launched on a limited basis in 
2023, a first step towards improving the circularity of our sachets. We will continue to 
report on the progress of this rollout and improvements on recycling infrastructure. 

In collaboration with The Sustainability Consortium, we also joined forces with our 
peers to improve the recyclability of small format packaging. Small format packaging 
such as sachets and portion cups are essential to helping reduce waste. However, the 
recyclability of smaller packaging is challenging as it often falls through the cracks 
of many materials recovery and recycling facilities. In 2022, the group began waste 
characterization work as well as sponsored research with the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology focused on sorting technology for capturing small format plastic for recycling 
at materials recovery facilities. 

In Europe, we are working closely with the HolyGrail 2.0 Project, which aims to simplify 
the waste sorting process by using digital watermarking technology. Digital watermarking 
technology prints and/or embosses patterns directly onto packaging which can then be 
spotted by an optical sorter at a recycling facility. In 2022, Kraft Heinz collaborated with 
the project to evaluate how well this technology detects and sorts our products. Moving 
forward, we will continue to collaborate with HolyGrail to further test and roll out  
this initiative. 

We expanded our pilot with Loop, a waste-free shopping 
platform that allows consumers to responsibly buy 
products in refillable packaging which is then collected, 
cleaned, and refilled after use. Our first trials began 
in Canada and the U.K. in 2020 and 2021. In 2022, we 
expanded our pilot to the U.S. Last year in the U.S., 
we conducted multiple pilots in collaboration with 
retailers Kroger, Walmart and Giant and worked with 
approximately 36 of their stores across select cities in 
Oregon, Arkansas, Washington DC, and Virginia to test 
reuse of our iconic glass Heinz ketchup bottle with consumers and glean insights from 
implementing Loop’s fully circular process in our manufacturing operation.

In 2022, Kraft Heinz joined the Consumer Good Forum (CGF) Plastic Waste Coalition of 
Action. The aim of the Plastic Waste Coalition of Action is to accelerate the industry’s 
effort to tackle the plastic pollution challenge and help advance a world where no plastic 
becomes waste.

Heinz and Tesco Snap  
into Soft Plastics Recycling  
In July 2022, Heinz and Tesco partnered to launch a pioneering trial that could potentially 
lead to important change across the wider food industry when it comes to tackling 
the U.K.’s soft plastic recycling challenge. As part of the collaboration, we took the soft 
plastic returned to Tesco stores by customers and worked with specialists to create 
recyclable Heinz Beanz Snap Pots made with 39% recycled soft plastics. The pilot project 
is projected to recycle approximately 22 tons of plastic. The recycled plastic used in the 
snappable pots is certified on a mass balance basis by the ISCC, a global sustainability 
certification system that supports the transition to a circular economy. The project was  
a winner of the 2022 U.K. packaging awards and Packaging Innovation Award,  
organized by Dow.

“This innovative collaboration is one of the ways that soft plastic returned to stores by 
our customers will be recycled into new food-grade packaging. After doing everything we 
can to remove and reduce plastic, we want to develop circular recycling solutions like 
this so the materials we use stay in our packaging and out of the environment.”

RESPONSIBLE SOURCING

One of our six Values at Kraft Heinz is: We Do the Right Thing. We take responsibility for contributing 
to improvements that protect our planet, drive responsible business practices along our global 
supply chain, and support the communities where we live and work. Please visit our supplier hub 
for the latest policies on our responsible sourcing program.

RISK ASSESSMENT AND DUE DILIGENCE

In 2022, we further improved our approach to data-driven sustainability 
risk management. To navigate this landscape effectively and ensure a 
proactive approach to risk assessment management, we expanded our 
partnership with ELEVATE*, now known as LRQA, due to their market-
leading expertise in ESG, sustainability, and supply chain services.

A key outcome of this work was a global ESG risk assessment which 
identified the 10 most critical risks across the Kraft Heinz supply chain. 
These findings help guide our strategy, influence decision making, and 
inform our Due Diligence program. This program helps us monitor our 
supply chain for potential human rights risks and non-compliances with 
the help of Sedex (direct suppliers) and EcoVadis (indirect suppliers) and 
take decisive action in remediating issues as they occur. 

Our global supply chain touches the lives of communities around the world. It is our 
responsibility to make sure our operations have a positive impact. We take a risk-based 
approach to due diligence aligned with the United Nations Guiding Principles. This model 
complements our Supplier Guiding Principles and defines how and when risk will be 
monitored, assessed, and managed. Compliance with our Supplier Guiding Principles – 
the basis of our ESG due diligence and ESG audit program –  is a contractual obligation for 
Kraft Heinz suppliers globally. 

Kraft Heinz is a member of Sedex and EcoVadis in order to align our supplier ESG 
requirements with industry standards and recognize existing supplier efforts to manage 
ESG risks. We are actively developing our Responsible Sourcing program in a way that 
harmonizes supplier requirements and reduces administrative burdens on our suppliers – 
allowing our teams to focus resources on driving ESG improvements in areas that  
need it most.

Kraft Heinz began a worldwide supplier roll out of Sedex and EcoVadis in 2021 and 
continues to make good progress in implementing this best practice. This helps us elevate 
standard practices across our supply base and track their progress through provided 
performance data.

 * ELEVATE was acquired by LRQA in April 2022

SUPPLIER GUIDING PRINCIPLES 

At Kraft Heinz, we recognize our suppliers as partners and want to bring them to the table to advance the sustainability agenda. Our 
Supplier Guiding Principles (SGPs) apply to our upstream supply chain and clearly define both our minimum requirements, as well as 
our aspirational destinations, for the conduct and sustainable operation of our supplier network.

Our SGPs were developed using industry best practices and internationally recognized standards, including the United Nations 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the International Bill of Human Rights, and the principles set forth in the 
International Labor Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.

These principles continue to be included in our standard contract language and are publicly 
available in 26 languages through our supplier hub. In 2022, supplier compliance with the SGPs 
was implemented as a key performance indicator for the Kraft Heinz global procurement team.

Engagement through Education 
Engaging our global procurement team and our suppliers on ESG is a critical part of 
our responsible sourcing program. Kraft Heinz Ownerversity, our online learning and 
development platform, features several employee-focused trainings about the SGPs. All 
Kraft Heinz procurement professionals have been trained using this tool and e-training is 
mandatory for new members. We have also rolled out our SGP training for our suppliers 
which has proven to be a foundational resource in developing existing suppliers and 
onboarding new suppliers into the Kraft Heinz ecosystem.

HUMAN RIGHTS 

Kraft Heinz is strongly committed to respecting human rights in our operations and 
throughout our global value chain. We continue to stress the urgency and value of an 
ethical and transparent supply chain and are dedicated to the eradication of slavery and 
human trafficking. We partner with thousands of ingredients, packaging, and logistics 
suppliers and external manufacturers globally. They all share our commitment to 
ensuring that there is no modern slavery within our supply chain. 

We continuously monitor and evaluate their compliance with our policies and local laws 
through our due diligence processes and audits, which are embedded in our supplier 
selection and contracting procedures.

Our Global Human Rights Policy is guided by internationally recognized standards, 
including the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the 
International Bill of Human Rights and the principles set forth in the International Labor 
Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.

As part of the Global Human Rights Policy, Kraft Heinz requires 
all employees and related entities, suppliers, and business 
partners to strictly adhere to our human rights standards, which, 
in summary:

•   Prohibit child and underage employment; 
•   Prohibit trafficking, forced, or involuntary prison labor;
•   Prohibit any and all forms of abuse, bribery, harassment, and 

discrimination; 

•   Recognize and respect the rights of freedom of association and 

collective bargaining; 

•   Recognize and respect fair, legal, and equitable work 

timeframes, working conditions (including health and safety), 
and wages; 

•   Recognize land rights, natural resources, and ensure all workers’ rights to clean water 

and adequate sanitation facilities; 

•   Require all labor recruitment and employment procedures to be carried out in a legal 

and ethical manner.

Duty of Vigilance  
and Modern Slavery 
Here at Kraft Heinz, we live our Values of We do the right thing, and We dare to do better 
every day. Leading with honesty and integrity, we will always do right by our customers, 
partners, suppliers, and the communities we serve. 

In 2022, we created a taskforce on the Duty of Vigilance and Modern Slavery to share 
best practices across our entire organization and to deliver a coordinated response to 
environmental and human rights risks. The cross functional taskforce meets monthly, 
and includes senior representation from Procurement, Legal, Communications, and ESG 
teams. In the future, the Kraft Heinz Global Vigilance Plan and Modern Slavery Statement 
will be published. Within this document, we will share our steps to achieve our strategic 
goals on these important topics. This progress is in large part thanks to the strong 
alliances we have built with suppliers, nonprofit partners, and our global employees.

SUPPLIER DIVERSITY PROGRAM

The Kraft Heinz Supplier Diversity program embeds our company Values into our supply base 
to better reflect the communities that we serve. Launched last year and starting at first in the 
U.S., the program is intended to play a critical role in addressing systemic barriers which may 
stand between under-represented groups and the opportunity to be a supplier to Kraft Heinz. 
We are committed to the fair inclusion of diverse suppliers in procurement activities because 
we believe this promotes diversity, promotes diversity of thought and innovation, opens doors, 
creates partnerships that fuel the economy, and will unlock strategic value for our business.

We strive to partner with diverse suppliers that are at least 51 percent owned, operated, and 
managed by women, people of color, LGBTQ+ people, persons with disabilities, veterans, and 
other recognized minorities, with a goal of tripling spend with such organizations by 2025. 
The company will continue to partner with small businesses and those suppliers certified 
by the U.S. Small Business Administration’s HUBZone program, which fuels small business 
growth in historically underutilized business zones. To accelerate and amplify the impact of 
the Supplier Diversity Program, we also founded an internal community of Supplier Diversity 
Representatives across our North American procurement teams. 

In 2022, we expanded our external outreach in the U.S. by joining 
the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC) and the 
National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC).

WBENC is a leading non-profit organization dedicated to helping 
women-owned businesses thrive. Our engagements with WBENC 
help us expand opportunities for women entrepreneurs within our 
value chain while also connecting with new prospective supply 
chain partners. The NMSDC is the longest-operating business 
growth engine for the broadest group of systematically excluded 
communities of color (Asian-Indian, Asian-Pacific, Black, Hispanic, 
and Native American) and as a member, we are highly committed to 
contributing to their mission to advance economic equity for minority 
businesses. As the Supplier Diversity Program matures, we plan to expand this outreach  
across other recognized minority groups. 

Increasing Gender  
Equality in Brazilian Logistics – One Step  
at a Time  
Here at Kraft Heinz, We demand diversity. Globally, women are still fighting for equal 
representation and treatment in the workplace, particularly in the logistics industry. In 
Brazil, only two percent of truck drivers are women, and these women report that they 
often face prejudice on the job. Our Kraft Heinz procurement logistics team in Brazil 
wanted to play a part in the solution and created a strategy to drive supplier diversity and 
lead change.

Through this program, we engaged and challenged our suppliers to join us in employing 
more women in our transport operations. Two of our key suppliers accepted this challenge 
and have since secured permanent employment for two women drivers and put a number 
of pink trucks driven by women (pictured above) into circulation. While we are starting 
small, our goal is to grow the number of women drivers through 2023 and beyond to 
make up at least 50 percent of our Tier 1 fleet.

We are committed to respecting our environment and to eliminating deforestation and 
natural ecosystem conversion from our supply chains. This includes long-term protection and 
remediation where necessary.

We believe that conservation and protection of forests and natural ecosystems are fundamental 
to good business and to address the climate change our world is facing. We have both the 
ability and responsibility to drive positive change in these areas through our global work.

In 2022, Kraft Heinz committed to advancing our responsible sourcing program to include new 
no deforestation and conversion roadmaps, underpinning the release of our new Global No 
Deforestation Policy. This policy and the supporting roadmaps were developed in partnership 
with Proforest, a non-profit specializing in responsible production and sourcing of agricultural 
and forest commodities. In 2022, we completed a deforestation and conversion-free analysis 
of our value chain and developed 10-year roadmaps for our primary deforestation-linked 
commodities.  

Kraft Heinz commits to no deforestation across its primary deforestation-
linked commodities, with a target date of 2025. Beyond this, we are 
committed to working within our own operations and with our suppliers and 
business partners to achieve conversion-free practices by 2030. This includes 
management and reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and water 
consumption, and maintenance and protection of biodiversity, natural habitats, 
water sources, and water bodies.

Our policy will be released externally in 2023 and will align with the 
Accountability Framework initiative guidance, the Science Based Target 
Initiative (SBTi), as well as sectorial approaches, where they exist. To bring this 
commitment to life, Kraft Heinz is committed to working with our suppliers and 
business partners to implement best practices and facilitate compliance with 
this policy.

Kraft Heinz believes that animals deserve a good quality of life and to be treated humanely. 
We have an unwavering commitment to the care of animals in our supply chain. Although we 
neither own nor manage farms, we align with our suppliers in requiring that their animals be 
treated with care, understanding, and respect. 

Kraft Heinz believes that good animal welfare includes three elements which guide our animal 
welfare policies and initiatives: 

•   Health and Productivity: healthy animals that are provided with quality shelter, feed, 

and water;

•   Emotional Well-Being: negative experiences minimized and positive experiences 

enhanced;

•   Naturalness: animals perform important species-specific behaviors. 

This concept of animal welfare builds upon the internationally recognized “Five Freedoms” of 
animal welfare which include the fundamental principles of 1) freedom from hunger and thirst, 
2) freedom from physical and thermal discomfort, 3) freedom from pain, injury, or disease, 
4) freedom to express normal behaviors, and 5) freedom from fear and distress. As such, we 
will continue to work with animal welfare experts and suppliers on best practices to eliminate 
painful procedures and promote sustainable practices.

Source 100% of eggs in Europe from free-range  
hens. 

PROGRESS

100%

We support housing designs that allow animals to perform species-specific behaviors. 
Examples include, but are not limited to, cage-free housing with perches and nest boxes 
for laying hens and group housing for gestating sows. When painful procedures need to be 
performed, we encourage pain mitigation, such as the use of anesthetics or analgesics. Kraft 
Heinz expects its suppliers to implement practices and pursue continuous improvement 
consistent with the Five Freedoms and good animal welfare.

Public interest in farming and animal care is increasing, and consumers desire farming 
practices that match their values and expectations. Good animal welfare, environmental 
sustainability, and healthy people form an interconnected system, and well-managed farms 
reduce waste and provide a safe, nutritious food supply. Knowing this, we integrate science and 
societal ethics in our animal welfare decisions. Our Global Animal Welfare Policy and Supplier 
Implementation Guide are available on our Supplier Hub.

* Kraft Heinz defines “cage-free or better” eggs as sourced from laying hens that come from cage-free, free-range, pasture-raised, or similar natural or open housing settings.

ANIMAL WELFARE (CONT.)

Animal Welfare Outreach and Education

Our Supply Partners

Kraft Heinz participates in various animal welfare outreach and education initiatives. 
Historically, we have worked with academia to establish an undergraduate research internship 
program. The students in this program worked with academic and industry experts to develop 
supplier questionnaires on dairy calf management, broiler transport, and their swine  
welfare programs. 

Additionally, our animal welfare specialists partner with suppliers on animal welfare 
improvement projects, such as developing a customized turkey load-out and transport audit. 
They serve on the animal welfare committees of the North American Meat Institute and the 
National Turkey Federation. Within Kraft Heinz, our specialists provide training on farm animal 
production and welfare to cross-functional team members and leads our ESG Steering Group 
Subcommittee on Animal Welfare.

Our suppliers are our partners in humane animal care and its 
continuous improvement. We expect suppliers to maintain strict 
standards of animal care and raise animals in accordance with the 
laws and ordinances in their locale. We require our suppliers to have 
a zero-tolerance policy for animal abuse and neglect, and to train 
all individuals working with or around live animals accordingly. 
In addition to the Global Animal Welfare Policy, animal welfare 
expectations are delineated in the Kraft Heinz Ingredient Supplier 
Quality Expectations Manual and product specifications. When 
evidence of non-compliance is found, Kraft Heinz may suspend the 
supplier until corrective actions have been implemented. Suppliers 
who do not align with the requirements or do not make continuous 
and positive improvements to meet them risk losing Kraft Heinz  
as a customer.

Primal Kitchen® Cares for People  
and Planet by Sourcing Premium Ingredients 
Like High-Quality, Certified-Humane and 
Cage-Free Eggs  
Our Primal Kitchen brand believes consumers should not need to choose between great 
taste and real ingredients. The brand has long been delighting consumers by offering a 
wide range of pantry staples without dairy, gluten, grain, artificial sweeteners, and soy, 
all without sacrificing flavor. The Primal Kitchen impact extends far beyond their product 
offerings. They are committed to sourcing and selecting premium, purposeful ingredients, 
with a strong emphasis on animal welfare, which is exemplified by their use of high-
quality 100% ASPCA certified humane and cage-free eggs. Primal Kitchen also actively 
supports organizations dedicated to fighting food insecurity and creating a better future 
for people and the planet.

ANIMAL HEALTH & MANAGEMENT

Laying Hens 

European Chicken Commitment 

Antimicrobials 

The ability to engage in normal behaviors such as walking, nesting, and dust-bathing is 
important to laying hen welfare. Therefore, by 2025 we are globally committed to purchasing 
only cage-free eggs or better. Kraft Heinz defines “cage-free or better” eggs as sourced from 
laying hens that come from cage-free, free-range, pasture-raised, or similar natural or open 
housing settings. Hens in both cage-free and free-range housing are provided with litter, 
perches, and nest boxes. In 2022, 67 percent of the eggs and egg products* we purchased 
globally were cage-free or better. In Europe, 100 percent of the eggs and egg products* 
we purchased globally were free-range. Our reporting includes both internal and external 
manufacturing plants that make egg-containing products for us. 

Pigs 

In accordance with our three elements of animal welfare, we believe that pregnant sows should 
be safely housed in social groups with enough space to perform normal behaviors. While we 
do not own farms, we have a commitment to the care of animals, and therefore work closely 
with our suppliers to achieve our animal welfare goals. There are few farms that offer pigs 
housed in social groups, and thus supply is very limited. Even so, we are committed to phasing 
out the purchase of pork from suppliers who use gestation stalls. With Prop 12 in California 
and Question 3 in Massachusetts, we are fully prepared and ready to ship product to those 
markets from pigs housed in open pens. In 2022, 24 percent of our global and 98 percent of our 
European pork supply came from sows housed in group pen gestation.

Broiler Chickens 

We have committed to improving broiler welfare by 2024. We continue to incorporate leading 
science into our assessment of broiler welfare while also engaging with the industry at large as 
it redefines its guidelines for enhanced broiler welfare. We will incorporate a combination of 
outcome-based and practice-based metrics that are shown to demonstrably increase animal 
welfare while also being cognizant of our greenhouse gas footprint. We continue to engage with 
our United States supply partners in meeting enhanced broiler chicken welfare standards.

* Kraft Heinz does not directly purchase any shell eggs.

In late 2019, Kraft Heinz expanded its animal welfare commitments to improving chicken 
welfare by 2026 as part of the European Chicken Commitment. Kraft Heinz continues to assess 
and work to transition its European supply chain accordingly. Though this commitment faces 
some challenges related to supply, we remain steadfast in our commitment to require 100 
percent of the fresh, frozen, and processed chicken in our European supply chain to meet this 
standard. We look forward to continued engagement with our suppliers toward this objective.

Dairy Cattle 

We require our U.S. suppliers to follow the National Milk Producers Federation’s Farmers 
Assuring Responsible Management (FARM) Animal Care guidelines. This program establishes 
best on-farm animal management practices and includes second-party evaluations and third-
party verification. 66 percent of our dairy supply comes from U.S. farms. Our Canadian suppliers 
follow the National Farm Animal Care Council’s Code of Practice for the Care and Handling of 
Dairy Cattle. Third-party audits are required to ensure that the U.S. and Canadian programs’ 
guidelines are followed.

Humane Endings 

We believe animals should be provided a respectful and humane death. Compromised animals 
must be euthanized in a timely manner that aligns with the American Veterinary Medical 
Association (AVMA) or World Organisation for Animal Health’s (WOAH) guidelines. Similarly, 
slaughter should also align with these guidelines. Efficient stunning prior to slaughter is 
important for animal welfare. 100 percent of our U.S. Oscar Mayer product suppliers report 
that they comply with our product specifications which require an annual third-party humane 
slaughter audit and regular internal animal welfare audits.

Disease prevention strategies such as husbandry, hygiene, and vaccinations must be the 
primary defenses against animal disease. However, even with excellent care, farm animals 
sometimes become ill. When this occurs, antimicrobial treatment (including antibiotics) 
can be an important component of humane animal care. Therapeutic antimicrobials should 
only be used after careful review by a veterinarian and treatment limited to ill and at-risk 
animals, treating the fewest animals possible. Alongside good farm management, responsible 
antimicrobial use can help protect food quality and enhance safety. In the United States, 
where the majority of Kraft Heinz meat ingredients are purchased, we require our suppliers 
to meet or exceed the AVMA or WOAH guidelines for the judicious use of antimicrobial agents. 
Our meat and dairy products meet or exceed government regulations related to the use and 
administration of antimicrobials, including compliance with bans on antibiotics for  
growth promotion.

Hormones 

While studies conclude hormone supplements in cattle are safe for animals and for humans, 
we support ongoing research efforts to further demonstrate the safety and usefulness of 
supplemental hormones. For example, recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST) is a hormone 
that can increase milk production in dairy cattle. Globally its usage varies widely in accordance 
with government regulations. In the United States, for example, hormones (including rbST) 
are not allowed to be used for growth promotion in pigs or poultry. In some countries, growth 
hormones are approved for use in beef and dairy cattle. We do not restrict their use in those 
instances. However, we support wider industry initiatives to eliminate rbST from the supply.

Testing of Food Ingredients 

Kraft Heinz does not support or condone the use of animals for research that is not essential 
to food safety, and we do not maintain any testing facilities. When legally required by 
governmental agencies, ingredient safety testing is completed by accredited third-party 
facilities following appropriate animal welfare guidelines. We do not support unnecessary 
testing and are advocates for replacing animal testing with other validated research methods.

ANIMAL WELFARE RISK ASSESSMENTS

Annually, all Kraft Heinz suppliers of animal and animal-derived products are requested to complete an animal welfare risk self-assessment. The assessment was developed by a cross-functional internal panel that included 
animal welfare, procurement, and quality team members and was reviewed by an external team of animal welfare scientists. The assessments review suppliers’ strengths and weaknesses on animal welfare policies, 
personnel training, transportation, stunning methods, and auditing. Kraft Heinz’s animal welfare team works with lower performing suppliers, which make up a small percentage of our total supply chain, to create action 
plans to develop policies and procedures that improve animal welfare. Low performing suppliers unwilling or unable to improve animal welfare may jeopardize their status as Kraft Heinz suppliers. Results of our 2022 
assessment are listed below and more details can be found on pages 75-79.

As a food and beverage company, we recognize the importance of sustainable agriculture in our products. Through the work of 
our experienced agronomists and procurement teams, we are proud to work with our suppliers to advance sustainable agriculture 
practices, knowing that the ingredients we source are integral to our business and to the well-being of our consumers and 
communities in which we operate. 

At Kraft Heinz, we have a long history of working with growers to promote sustainable 
agricultural practices. We support a wide variety of sustainable agricultural practices that 
maintain soil health to ensure the production of food for generations to come. We also adopt 
next generation seed breeding within HeinzSeed. Tomato plants grown from our own seeds are 
known for their disease resistance and reliable high yields. With their firmness, enhanced color 
and viscosity, they also need less water, use optimal pesticides and fertilizers, and ultimately, 
require less land to produce.

Through research in our laboratories and with experienced agronomist teams on the ground, 
we strive to stay at the forefront of sustainable agriculture, applying what we learn through 
trials and demonstrations. The Kraft Heinz Sustainable Agriculture Practices Manual forms 
the foundation of our engagement strategy with growers, as we work towards our 2025 goal to 
source 100 percent of tomatoes for Heinz tomato ketchup sustainably. 

We continue to dig deep in our roots to use 150 years of forward-looking, 
responsible agricultural and human rights practices to build on our legacy with 
our farmers. We are committed to further building on our strong sustainability 
heritage, as Henry J. Heinz (founder of the H.J. Heinz Company) famously 
noted, “Protect the consumer by owning the product all the way from the soil  
to the table.”

SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL  
PRACTICES MANUAL

Sustainable farming practices do more than save important natural resources. They also have the potential to considerably increase 
crop yields and provide growers and their families with greater economic opportunity. Kraft Heinz has taken significant steps to 
strengthen our Sustainable Agriculture Practices Manual (SAPM) and is working in partnership with growers to implement those 
practices.

We have introduced our updated manual to suppliers and growers in both Spain and 
California, key growing regions for Heinz tomatoes. To reduce the burden on growers, 
allowing them to focus on the continuous improvement philosophy we promote, we 
elected to benchmark our SAPM to SAI Platform’s Farm Sustainability Assessment 
(FSA), the recognized industry tool for assessing on-farm sustainability. We achieved 
an equivalent performance level of FSA Silver. This enables growers to demonstrate 
compliance with our requirements through adoption of the FSA itself, or though other 
benchmarked standards that meet the minimum performance level of FSA Silver. 

In 2022, we canvassed our suppliers to map any pre-existing voluntary sustainability 
standards that their growers used in their daily practices. We found that 56 percent of 
our Heinz ketchup tomato volumes were already sustainably produced. Building on this 
with further FSA audits, we completed the year with 75 percent sustainably sourced Heinz 
ketchup tomatoes and are well on track towards our 2025 target of 100 percent. We will 
continue to roll out audits and verification to ensure supplier compliance with these 
standards. We are also actively working with suppliers of navy beans and other crops and 
brands to expand the scope of our sustainable agricultural program. 

Building the Regenerative Capacity of Agriculture Through  
a Global, Farmer-Centered, Industry-led Initiative

The long-term resilience of agriculture arguably now depends on how quickly we can 
develop regenerative systems that benefit soil health, biodiversity, water supply, climate 
resilience, and grower livelihoods. Kraft Heinz is a founding member of SAI Platform’s new 
Regenerative Agriculture Program along with approximately 30 companies from across 
the agricultural value chain. The purpose of the program is to build industry alignment, 
reduce duplication, and amplify impact through the creation of a universal framework 
with locally implementable indicators, to ensure accessibility and applicability of 
regenerative agriculture principles, practices and most importantly, positive outcomes 
on farms. The program will work to scientifically validate regenerative principles, engage 
with farmers, and develop a mechanism for corporations to verify and communicate 
regenerative impacts to external stakeholders. 

Throughout 2022, Kraft Heinz Director of Agricultural Sustainability, Martina Henry,  
co-chaired the Regenerative Agriculture Program Steering Committee and, along with the 
group of Founding Members and the SAI Platform Secretariat, worked to engage relevant 
industry stakeholders and other SAI Platform members and working groups.

“As we develop and define new regenerative agriculture approaches, it is the farmer’s 
inherent knowledge of the land, its constraints and opportunities, that is critical to 
ensuring successful social and environmental outcomes based on solid economic 
foundations.” 

– Martina Henry, Director, Agriculture Sustainability, Kraft Heinz and SAI Platform 
Regenerative Agriculture Program Steering Committee member

FSA 3.0 Benchmark Equivalence for 
Sustainable Agriculture Practices Manual  
Our Sustainable Agricultural Practices Manual is benchmarked against SAI Platform’s 
Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA) 3.0 and received ‘Silver Level equivalence.’ This was 
the first sustainability program successfully benchmarked against the updated FSA 3.0 
which was released in April 2021. 

We believe this benchmark will help us and our suppliers in our journey towards 
purchasing 100 percent sustainably sourced Heinz ketchup tomatoes by 2025. It 
provides a pathway for growers to demonstrate compliance with our requirements, while 
also offering a single, industry-aligned tool that reduces duplication and audit fatigue. 
This allows growers to focus on improving their operations and continuing to grow the 
quality, sustainable ingredients we rely on to produce our brands. 

“FSA 3.0 marks a step up in the benchmarking program’s integrity, yet it is even more 
straightforward and easier to get started. It is great to see The Kraft Heinz Company 
getting the most out of their membership with Sustainable Agriculture Initiative 
(SAI) Platform by using the FSA to refine, communicate and scale their program. We 
congratulate them on this achievement!” 

– Joe Rushton, FSA Director at SAI Platform

KEY SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE INITIATIVES 

Partnership with the reNature Foundation:  
Save our Soils Program

During 2022, we commissioned specialist consultancy organization reNature to support 
our efforts to gain an understanding of the potential for carbon sequestration in our 
tomato supply chain. At the end of the year, we further cemented this partnership with 
reNature, with a focus on helping us engage our direct tomato grower base in Brazil to 
advance our sustainable sourcing and decarbonization objectives, including building 
capacity in our local agronomy team and growers and exploring innovative techniques 
to build climate resiliency. This project will commence in 2023 and we look forward to 
sharing insights and updates on progress we make in future reports.

Supporting Farm Resilience in California 

As part of our ongoing commitment to continuous improvement on farms, in 2021 we 
introduced a pilot cover crop program with our California tomato growers. The objective 
of the pilot is to incentivize the adoption of cover crops as a practice that can help 
promote soil health, enhance water holding capacity, reduce reliance on chemical inputs, 
and support biodiversity while increasing yields. In 2022, we expanded this pilot as part of 
a broader soil health program which we estimate to be double the size of our  
2021 reach.

ESG Education in Egypt

We take our responsibility to educate our partners 
about sustainability very seriously. This commitment 
is especially important in developing markets such 
as Egypt, where we have direct contracts with 
growers and the level of knowledge about sustainable 
agriculture is developing. 

In 2022, Egyptian growers were immersed  
into sustainable farming methods during on-site 
educational events focused on the topics of climate 
change, and health, and safety. Tangible, real-world case studies grew their awareness of 
how they can positively impact climate change and worker well-being in their daily work. 
Another important topic in the events was increasing the growers’ knowledge about 
tomato diseases and the safe and sustainable use of pesticides. The events enhanced the 
growers’ sense of being part of a bigger goal, in which we all aim to do the right thing.

Introducing Assan Foods to the Kraft Heinz Sustainable  
Way of Working

Following the acquisition of Turkish entity Assan Foods by Kraft Heinz, we undertook 
assessments to support the integration of the business and alignment with Kraft Heinz 
ESG priorities, including our Sustainable Agricultural Practices Manual. We commissioned 
a local supply chain and sustainable agriculture expert to undertake an extensive six-
month study of the Turkish tomato industry which analyzed the nature of the supply 
chain and the relative maturity of growers in terms of sustainable farming, human rights, 
and climate resiliency. The findings have been used to inform our ongoing engagement 
and support strategies to address identified gaps and build a more equitable, climate-
resilient, and sustainable supply of tomatoes in Turkey. To further support growers, we 
commissioned the translation of the FSA from English into Turkish, which is now available 
and open-sourced on SAI Platform’s website for all FSA users.

SUPPLIER SPOTLIGHT  

At Kraft Heinz, we recognize that we cannot succeed in our ESG journey alone. Therefore, we are committed to bringing bold, 
innovative, and like-minded partners ‘Together at the Table’ to help lead the way, like Woolf Farming. In 2022, this innovative 
agricultural company from California’s fertile Central Valley achieved a 100 percent Gold result on their Kraft Heinz FSA audit. 

Woolf Farming: Farming with a commitment to sustainability

In 1974 Jack Woolf founded Woolf Farming. Now, three 
generations later, Woolf is still committed to producing 
more high-quality crops with fewer resources while 
improving the land they farm. The family-owned 
and operated farm, together with their partners, 
sustainably grow and processes specialty crops, 
delivering almonds, pistachios, tomatoes, cotton, 
garlic, wheat, and more to the food chain. 

Woolf Farming is highly committed to sustainable 
farming practices. As stewards of land in California’s Central Valley, they take their 
obligation to sustainably manage the region’s natural resources very seriously. That 
is why Woolf saw the urgency to certify as a B Corporation, which means they adhere 
to exceptionally high standards of social commitment, environmental performance, 
operational transparency, and legal accountability.

The desire to be early adopters of technology and innovation allows Woolf 
to maximize both quality and yield, while also enhancing the value of their 
natural resources. Combined with ongoing investment in land, water, 
infrastructure, and processing, this has enabled Woolf Farming to grow  
and prosper.

“We’re proud of our long-term relationship with Kraft Heinz. Together we’ve 
taken constructive steps to improve our farming practices and the quality 
of our goods.  For example, they have supported our use of cover crops to 
improve water penetration, and reduce the need for fertilizers while improving 
overall soil health.  My hope is to pass this strategic collaboration, while 
improving our family’s land, on to our next generation.  We look forward to 
building on this legacy of sustainability and trust.”  

– Stuart Woolf, CEO, Woolf Farming

Kraft Heinz defines “cage-free or better” 
eggs as sourced from laying hens that 
come from cage-free, free-range, pasture-
raised, or similar natural or open housing 
settings. Hens in both cage-free and 
free-range housing are provided with litter, 
perches and nest boxes.

When required by law or recommended by 
a veterinarian or other trusted animal health 
expert, free-range hens may be temporarily 
kept indoors to prevent illness and promote 
animal well-being.

Please note that some historical data has been updated from previous reports due to better data accuracy and due diligence. 

In 2022, we further improved our meal 
equivalency calculation methodology in 
close collaboration with a global partner, 
which we also applied retroactively from 
2020 to ensure consistency. This resulted 
in a lower restatement of historical meals 
from 2020-2021. We are still proudly on 
track to achieving our goal of providing 1.5 
billon meals to people in need in advance 
of 2025.

employees 

Black, Asian, Minority Ethnic; a commonly 
used abbreviation in the UK. The aspiration 
is based on a weighted average of the split 
between our populations in London office 
and our factories.

Pretos e Pardos translates to “Black & 
two or more races." 2022 goal progress 
excludes BR Spices and Hemmer 
acquisitions that occurred in 2022. These 
acquisitions are included in all other HR 
metrics.

Total employees include temporary, 
seasonal and student workers in addition 
to regular full-time employees. Note that 
all reported global employee metrics do 
not include employees that joined the 
Company as part of acquisitions that 
closed in the fourth quarter of 2022.
